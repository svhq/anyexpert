**Dr. Evelyn Reed, Plant Geneticist**

Greetings. I am Dr. Evelyn Reed, a plant geneticist specializing in molecular mechanisms of plant-pathogen interactions. I will analyze the results of your high-throughput experiment on white lupine and its resistance to anthracnose.

Your experiment aims to elucidate the roles of three candidate genes, G1, G2, and G3, in conferring resistance to anthracnose, using knockout mutants and their combinations. A key piece of information is that at least one of these genes functions as a transcription factor upstream of other genes. The provided resistance data, expressed as a percentage of wild-type resistance, will be used to infer gene interactions and formulate conclusions.

Let's systematically analyze the provided data to understand the genetic interactions:

**1. Phenotypic Analysis of Single Mutants:**
*   **g1 mutant:** Exhibits 75% of wild-type resistance. This indicates that G1 contributes to resistance, but its absence does not abolish it.
*   **g2 mutant:** Exhibits 0% resistance, meaning complete susceptibility. This suggests G2 plays a critical, likely essential, role in the resistance pathway.
*   **g3 mutant:** Exhibits 50% of wild-type resistance. G3 also contributes to resistance, but its contribution is less significant than that of G2.

**2. Phenotypic Analysis of Double Mutants:**
*   **g1g3 mutant:** Exhibits 10% of wild-type resistance. This is a severe reduction in resistance, significantly lower than either single mutant (75% for g1, 50% for g3). This observation implies that G1 and G3 may function in parallel pathways, or in complementary roles, where their combined absence is detrimental to overall resistance. The severe phenotype in the double mutant contradicts a simple model of complete redundancy where one gene's loss is fully compensated by the other.
*   **g2g3 mutant:** Exhibits 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the g2 single mutant.
*   **g1g2 mutant:** Exhibits 0% resistance. This phenotype is also identical to the g2 single mutant.

**3. Inferring Gene Function and Interactions:**

*   **Identification of the Transcription Factor:** The most compelling evidence points to **G2 being the transcription factor**. Its absence in the g2 mutant leads to complete susceptibility (0% resistance). Crucially, the presence of a mutation in either G1 (g1g2 mutant) or G3 (g2g3 mutant) does not alter this complete susceptibility. This indicates that G2 functions upstream in the resistance pathway, and its function is necessary for the activity of downstream components, including those potentially regulated by G1 and G3.

*   **Epistasis Analysis:**
    *   **G2 is epistatic to G1:** The g1g2 double mutant exhibits the same phenotype (0% resistance) as the g2 single mutant. This signifies that the loss of G1 function does not worsen the phenotype already caused by the loss of G2. This is a classic indication of G2 being epistatic to G1, likely meaning G1 acts downstream of G2 in the regulatory cascade.
    *   **G2 is epistatic to G3:** Similarly, the g2g3 double mutant shows the same phenotype (0% resistance) as the g2 single mutant. This demonstrates that G2 is also epistatic to G3, implying G3 acts downstream of G2 or in a pathway whose integrity relies on G2's function.

*   **Interaction between G1 and G3:** The interaction between G1 and G3 is complex. The severe phenotype of the g1g3 double mutant (10% resistance) compared to the single mutants (75% and 50%) suggests they are not simply redundant in a compensatory manner. Instead, they likely contribute to resistance through distinct mechanisms or pathways. The term "gene redundancy" in this context might be used loosely to imply that both genes are important contributors to the overall resistance, and their combined loss is critical.

*   **Epistasis between G1 and G3:** Let's consider the claim that "G1 is epistatic towards G3". Standard epistasis implies that the gene acting upstream (the epistatic gene) masks the phenotype of the gene acting downstream. If G1 is epistatic to G3, it suggests G1 acts upstream.
    *   g1 mutant: 75% resistance.
    *   g3 mutant: 50% resistance.
    If G1 is epistatic to G3, and assuming G1 acts upstream, then the absence of G1 should potentially lead to a more severe phenotype than the absence of G3, or G1's phenotype should dominate. However, the g1 mutant is *more* resistant (75%) than the g3 mutant (50%). This means the absence of G1 leads to a milder loss of resistance compared to the absence of G3. This observation does not neatly fit the typical definition of epistasis where the upstream gene's absence causes a more severe phenotype. However, in the context of multiple gene interactions, it could imply a hierarchy where G1 exerts control over G3's expression or function, and the resulting phenotype is a consequence of this regulatory relationship.

**Conclusion Based on Options:**

Let's evaluate the provided options:
*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** G1 is less likely to be the transcription factor than G2. Pleiotropy for G2 and G3 cannot be inferred from this data. G2 is epistatic to G1 is supported.
*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** G2 as a TF is well supported. The statement about promoters is not directly verifiable. G3 epistatic to G1 is not supported by the data; G2 is epistatic to both.
*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** G2 as a TF is strongly supported. Pleiotropy is not evident. G1 epistatic to G3 is questionable.
*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** G2 as a transcription factor is strongly supported. The interaction between G1 and G3, described as "gene redundancy" and "G1 is epistatic towards G3," are the most complex interpretations. However, given that G2 is the clear transcription factor and epistatic to both G1 and G3, and that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in a way that their combined absence is critical, this option presents the most coherent, albeit nuanced, interpretation of the data. The "redundancy" may refer to their shared role in contributing to resistance, and "G1 epistatic to G3" might reflect a regulatory hierarchy.

Therefore, based on the strongest deductions from the genetic data, Option D provides the most fitting conclusion.

The final answer is $\boxed{D}$.
