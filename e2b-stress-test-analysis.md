# E2B Stress Test Analysis: Critical Failures Under Load

## Test Parameters
- **Users:** 6 concurrent
- **Queries:** 12 total (2 per user)
- **Query Type:** All computation-heavy requiring E2B
- **Max Warm Sandboxes:** 10

## Critical Findings ðŸ”´

### 1. Catastrophic Failure Rate
- **E2B Failures:** 22 (out of ~10 executions)
- **E2B Retries:** 44
- **Success Rate:** ~31% (only 3 out of 10 E2B attempts succeeded)

### 2. Performance Degradation
- Query times ballooned from expected 20-30s to:
  - Eve Q1: 92 seconds
  - Bob Q1: 94 seconds  
  - Carol Q1: 282 seconds (4.7 minutes!)
  - David Q1: 315 seconds (5.2 minutes!)
  - Frank Q1: 317 seconds (5.3 minutes!)
  - Alice Q1: Still running after 6 minutes (timeout)

### 3. System Behavior
- Despite `maxWarmSandboxes=10`, only 0-1 sandboxes were active
- The system couldn't create sandboxes fast enough
- Massive retry storms (44 retries for 10 executions)
- Some queries didn't even attempt code execution (Eve, David)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: E2B Service Overload
The monitoring shows:
```
Sandboxes: 1/10 | Executions: 10 | Failures: 22 | Retries: 44
```

This indicates:
1. **Sandbox creation failures** - The system tried to create sandboxes but E2B service rejected most attempts
2. **Retry exhaustion** - Each failure triggered 2 retries (as configured), creating a cascade
3. **Queue congestion** - Later queries waited minutes for earlier ones to fail/retry

### Secondary Issues:
1. **No request queuing** - All 6 users hit E2B simultaneously
2. **No circuit breaker** - System kept retrying despite consistent failures
3. **No graceful degradation** - Some queries gave up on code execution entirely

## Why This Matters

1. **User Experience Destroyed**
   - 5+ minute response times are unacceptable
   - Some users got no code execution at all
   - System appeared frozen/broken

2. **Not Production Ready**
   - Current system cannot handle 6 concurrent compute-heavy users
   - E2B becomes a critical bottleneck under load
   - No visibility into why failures occur

3. **Scaling Limitations**
   - Simply increasing `maxWarmSandboxes` won't help if E2B service has rate limits
   - Need architectural changes, not just config tweaks

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Implement request queuing** - Don't let all requests hit E2B simultaneously
2. **Add circuit breaker** - Stop hammering E2B when it's failing
3. **Better error messages** - Tell users what's happening during delays

### Medium-term Solutions:
1. **Tiered execution strategy**:
   - Simple calculations: Local Python
   - Complex/untrusted: E2B
   - ML/Data science: Dedicated compute pool

2. **Smart routing**:
   - Analyze query complexity before routing
   - Reserve E2B for truly necessary cases

3. **E2B optimization**:
   - Contact E2B about rate limits
   - Consider enterprise tier
   - Implement sandbox reuse more aggressively

### Long-term Architecture:
1. **Hybrid execution model** - Don't rely solely on E2B
2. **Predictive scaling** - Pre-warm based on usage patterns
3. **Fallback hierarchy** - E2B â†’ Local containers â†’ Simplified calculations

## Conclusion
The system fails catastrophically under realistic load. With 6 users making compute-heavy requests, response times exceeded 5 minutes and E2B failures dominated. This is not a configuration issue - it's an architectural limitation that requires fundamental changes to handle production workloads.
