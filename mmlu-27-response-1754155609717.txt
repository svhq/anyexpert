As Dr. Evelyn Reed, a Sociologist specializing in Social Psychology, I can definitively confirm that Charles Cooley's concept of the "looking-glass self" emphasizes the development of the self through our perception of others' evaluations of us.

Cooley's theory, outlined in his seminal work "Human Nature and the Social Order" (1902), posits that our sense of self is not innate but is a social product, formed through a three-step imaginative process:

1.  **We imagine how we present ourselves to others.** This involves our interpretation of our outward appearance, actions, and character.
2.  **We imagine their judgment of that appearance.** We try to gauge how others perceive and evaluate us based on our perceived presentation.
3.  **We develop our self through the judgments of others.** Our self-concept, including feelings of pride or shame, arises from our interpretation of these perceived judgments. [1]

Reviewing the provided options against this framework:

*   **Option (B) "the self develops through our perception of others' evaluations of us"** directly and accurately reflects the core mechanism of the looking-glass self. The "looking-glass" is precisely this perceived reflection of ourselves in the minds of others, and our self-concept is built upon these perceived social judgments.

The other options are inaccurate because:

*   (A) limits the concept to physical appearance, whereas Cooley's theory encompasses all aspects of the self.
*   (C), (D), (G), and (H) contradict the social and developmental nature of the self as described by Cooley. He argued that the self is a dynamic, socially constructed entity, not fixed at birth or independent of social interaction.
*   (E) and (J) suggest biological or economic determinism, which is not the focus of Cooley's social-psychological theory. While these factors can influence social interactions, they are not the direct determinants of the self in his model.
*   (F) is incorrect because social roles are integral to how we interact with others and how we imagine they perceive us, thus significantly impacting our identity.
*   (I) is too restrictive; while childhood is a crucial period for self-development, the looking-glass self operates throughout life as social interactions and perceived evaluations continue to shape our sense of self.

Therefore, based on the foundational principles of Charles Cooley's theory, option (B) is the most accurate and comprehensive statement.

The final answer is **(B)**.
