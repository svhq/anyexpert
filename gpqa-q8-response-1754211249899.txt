As Professor Eleanor Vance, theoretical physicist specializing in electromagnetism, I can address your question about how Maxwell's equations would change in a universe with isolated magnetic poles (magnetic monopoles).

Maxwell's equations are a set of four fundamental equations that describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. In our universe, these equations reflect the empirical observation that magnetic charges (monopoles) do not exist; magnetic fields always arise from dipoles (North and South poles always together) [13, 23].

Let's examine each of Maxwell's equations and how their form would change if magnetic monopoles were present:

1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:**
    $$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_e}{\epsilon_0} $$
    This equation relates the divergence of the electric field ($\mathbf{E}$) to the electric charge density ($\rho_e$). The existence of magnetic monopoles does not directly alter this equation, as it specifically deals with electric charges.

2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:**
    $$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 $$
    This equation states that the divergence of the magnetic field ($\mathbf{B}$) is always zero. This is the mathematical expression of the fact that magnetic monopoles do not exist in our universe. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops; they do not originate from or terminate on isolated poles. If magnetic monopoles *did* exist, this equation would need to be modified to account for a magnetic charge density ($\rho_m$). A modified form would look like:
    $$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m $$
    where $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space and $\rho_m$ is the magnetic charge density [4, 10, 11, 18, 21, 35, 38]. This is the equation directly related to the divergence of the magnetic field.

3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:**
    $$ \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} $$
    This equation describes how a changing magnetic field induces an electric field (specifically, the curl of the electric field). The existence of magnetic monopoles does not, in itself, change this relationship. However, if magnetic monopoles were moving, they would create a magnetic field, and if this magnetic field were to change, it would induce an electric field according to this equation. The *presence* of monopoles doesn't alter the law itself, but their *behavior* would be governed by modified equations. Some generalized formulations that include monopoles might introduce a term related to the magnetic current density ($ \mathbf{J}_m $) here, leading to:
    $$ \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m $$
    This modified equation relates to the circulation (curl) of the electric field and the time rate of change of the magnetic field, and potentially magnetic currents.

4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law:**
    $$ \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_e + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} $$
    This equation describes how electric currents ($\mathbf{J}_e$) and changing electric fields ($\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$, the displacement current) generate magnetic fields (specifically, the curl of the magnetic field). If magnetic monopoles exist, and by analogy to electric charges creating electric currents, we would expect magnetic currents ($\mathbf{J}_m$) to also contribute to the curl of the magnetic field. The symmetric form of Maxwell's equations, which includes magnetic monopoles, would typically look like:
    $$ \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_e + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} + \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m $$
    This modified equation relates to the circulation (curl) of the magnetic field and would include a term for magnetic currents.

**Summary of Changes:**

The most direct and universally accepted modification to Maxwell's equations that arises from the hypothetical existence of magnetic monopoles is to Gauss's Law for Magnetism ($\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$), which would no longer be zero but would instead depend on a magnetic charge density ($\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m$) [4, 10, 11, 18, 21, 35, 38].

Furthermore, to maintain symmetry and incorporate the effects of magnetic currents (analogous to electric currents), the Ampère-Maxwell Law is also modified to include a magnetic current density term. Some formulations also extend Faraday's Law to include magnetic currents [39, 40].

Considering the options provided:

*   **A) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field.** This is definitely affected (Gauss's Law for Magnetism).
*   **B) The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.** This is also affected, as both Gauss's Law for Magnetism and the Ampère-Maxwell Law are modified to include magnetic charges and currents, respectively.
*   **C) The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.** The divergence of the magnetic field is affected. The circulation of the electric field (Faraday's Law) can be modified in a symmetric formulation.
*   **D) The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field.** The circulation of the magnetic field (Ampère-Maxwell Law) is affected. The flux of the electric field is represented by Gauss's Law for Electricity, which is not directly changed by the *existence* of magnetic monopoles.

However, the most fundamental and universally agreed-upon change is to Gauss's Law for Magnetism. The question asks "which of those equations are different?". The divergence of the magnetic field is the most direct indicator of magnetic charge. If we consider a fully symmetric set of Maxwell's equations (often called the "generalized" or "symmetric" Maxwell's equations), then both the divergence of B and the curl of B (and implicitly Faraday's Law and Ampere-Maxwell Law to maintain consistency) are altered to include magnetic charge and current terms.

The most definitive change, as supported by numerous sources, is to the equation describing the divergence of the magnetic field, which directly relates to the absence of magnetic monopoles in the standard formulation [10, 11, 18, 19, 21, 35, 38]. The other equations, particularly the Ampère-Maxwell law, are also modified to achieve a symmetric formulation that includes magnetic monopoles and currents [39, 40].

Given the options, and focusing on the core impact of isolated magnetic poles, the divergence of the magnetic field is the most directly and fundamentally altered equation. The curl of the magnetic field is also modified in a symmetric theory. Option B captures both of these aspects.

The final answer is **B) The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.**
