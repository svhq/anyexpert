After careful review of the League’s charter towns, principal kontore and trading affiliates, we find that every city listed except one was a core member or hosted a major Hanseatic kontor between the 13th and 17th centuries:

1. Lübeck (A) – Founder and “Queen” of the League from its inception in 1241; de facto headquarters. [1]  
2. Hamburg (B) – Early member; one of the League’s two great North Sea ports. [1]  
3. Bergen (C) – Site of the Norwegian kontor (“Bryggen”), operating under League auspices. [2]  
4. Novgorod (D) – Hosted the “Peterhof” kontor, vital to Rus’–Western trade. [1]  
5. Riga (F) – Admitted mid-13th c.; principal Baltic port and assembly site. [1]  
6. Danzig/Gdańsk (G) – Joined in the 14th c.; key southeastern Baltic harbor. [1]  
7. Visby (H) – Gotland’s chief town; summits of League diets were held here in peak years. [1]  
8. Cologne (I) – Westernmost major member on the Rhine; linked Baltic and Mediterranean commerce. [1]  
9. Stockholm (J) – Joined by 1252; important link for Swedish iron and copper exports. [1]  

By contrast:

10. Amsterdam (E) – Remained outside the Hanseatic federation. It only rose to pre-eminence in North Sea trade during the 16th–17th centuries, after the League had peaked and begun to decline. [3]

Conclusion: Of the options given, **E) Amsterdam** was NOT a major member of the Hanseatic League.
