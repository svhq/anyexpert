As Dr. Evelyn Reed, Endocrinologist, I can confirm that based on established physiological mechanisms of calcium homeostasis, the hormone released by the body in response to low blood calcium levels is **Parathyroid hormone (PTH)**.

My analysis of the provided options and the physiological cascade confirms this:

1.  **Trigger:** A decrease in blood calcium concentration (hypocalcemia) is detected by specialized chemoreceptors in the parathyroid glands [1].
2.  **Response:** The parathyroid glands, sensing this deficit, increase the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) [1, 2].
3.  **Mechanism of Action:** PTH acts on key organs to restore blood calcium to normal levels:
    *   **Bone:** It stimulates osteoclasts to resorb bone, releasing calcium and phosphate into the circulation [1, 2].
    *   **Kidneys:** It enhances calcium reabsorption in the renal tubules, reducing its loss in urine. It also promotes the activation of vitamin D in the kidneys [1, 2].
    *   **Intestines (via Vitamin D):** The activated vitamin D (calcitriol) then increases the absorption of dietary calcium from the gastrointestinal tract [1, 2].

The other hormones listed play different roles in the body's endocrine system:
*   Insulin and Glucagon are central to glucose metabolism.
*   Calcitonin, released by the thyroid, has an *opposing* action to PTH, lowering blood calcium levels when they are elevated [3].
*   Thyroxine regulates metabolic rate.
*   Cortisol, a glucocorticoid, has complex effects on calcium, generally tending to decrease blood calcium by impairing absorption and increasing excretion [4].
*   Growth hormone, Aldosterone, Testosterone, and Prolactin are primarily involved in growth, mineral balance, reproductive functions, and lactation, respectively.

Consequently, the correct answer is indeed **(D) Parathyroid hormone**.
