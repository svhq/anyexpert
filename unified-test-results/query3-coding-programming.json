    "answer": "As **Dr. Evelyn Reed, a Computational Mathematician**, I can certainly help you with this. Finding prime numbers within the Fibonacci sequence is a fascinating problem that combines number theory with algorithmic efficiency.\n\n### Mathematical Approach\n\n1.  **Fibonacci Sequence Generation:** The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$, with initial conditions $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$. To find terms up to the $n$th term, we can generate them iteratively.\n\n2.  **Primality Test:** A number $p$ is prime if it is greater than 1 and has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For efficiency, especially with large numbers, we'll use a robust primality test. A common and reasonably efficient method for numbers that aren't astronomically large is trial division up to the square root of the number. For very large numbers, more advanced probabilistic tests like Miller-Rabin are preferred, but for this problem, we'll stick to a deterministic approach that's efficient enough for typical competitive programming or educational contexts.\n\n    A number $N$ is prime if:\n    *   $N > 1$\n    *   $N$ is not divisible by any integer $d$ such that $1 < d \\le \\sqrt{N}$.\n\n    We can optimize this by only checking divisibility by 2, and then by odd numbers from 3 up to $\\sqrt{N}$.\n\n3.  **Combining Generation and Testing:** We will iterate through the Fibonacci sequence, generating each term. For each generated term, we will apply our primality test. If the term is found to be prime, we add it to our list of results.\n\n### Efficiency Considerations for Large `n`\n\n*   **Fibonacci Generation:** Iterative generation is $O(n)$ in terms of the number of operations, but the *magnitude* of the numbers grows exponentially. This means that arithmetic operations on these numbers will take longer as $n$ increases. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle this automatically, but it's important to be aware of the increasing cost of arithmetic.\n*   **Primality Test:** A naive trial division primality test for a number $N$ takes roughly $O(\\sqrt{N})$ time. Since Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially ($F_n \\approx \\phi^n / \\sqrt{5}$), the primality test for $F_n$ will take approximately $O(\\sqrt{\\phi^n}) = O(\\phi^{n/2})$ time. This can become very slow for large $n$.\n\nTo make it more efficient for \"large $n$\", we can use a more optimized primality test. The `sympy` library in Python provides a highly optimized `isprime` function that uses a combination of trial division, Miller-Rabin, and Lucas tests, making it very efficient for a wide range of numbers.\n\n### Python Implementation\n\nI will use `sympy` for its efficient primality testing.\n\n**Calculation:**\n```python\nimport sympy\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime_efficient(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is prime using sympy's efficient isprime function.\n    Handles edge cases for numbers less than 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    return sympy.isprime(n)\n\ndef find_prime_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all prime numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.\n\n    Args:\n        n: The number of terms to consider in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of prime Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n\n    prime_fib_numbers = []\n    a, b = 0, 1  # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers\n\n    # Handle the first term (F_0 = 0)\n    # 0 is not prime, so we don't check it.\n\n    # Handle the second term (F_1 = 1)\n    # 1 is not prime, so we don't check it.\n\n    # Generate Fibonacci numbers from the 3rd term onwards (index 2)\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        fib_term = a + b\n        \n        # Check if the current Fibonacci term is prime\n        if is_prime_efficient(fib_term):\n            prime_fib_numbers.append(fib_term)\n        \n        # Update for the next iteration\n        a = b\n        b = fib_term\n        \n        # Optional: For extremely large n, you might want to add a check\n        # to break early if numbers become unmanageably large, depending\n        # on system memory and time limits.
