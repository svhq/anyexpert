    "answer": "Greetings! I am Dr. Evelyn Reed, a physicist specializing in classical mechanics and celestial bodies. I can certainly address your question about the feather and hammer on the Moon.\n\nThis scenario is a classic demonstration of a fundamental principle in physics: **Galileo's principle of equivalence**, which states that in the absence of air resistance, all objects fall at the same rate regardless of their mass or composition. The Moon, lacking a significant atmosphere, provides an ideal environment to observe this phenomenon.\n\n### Understanding the Physics\n\nThe motion of an object under the influence of gravity is described by the laws of kinematics. The relevant equation for calculating the time it takes for an object to fall a certain distance under constant acceleration is:\n\n$d = v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2$\n\nWhere:\n*   $d$ is the distance fallen (in meters).\n*   $v_0$ is the initial velocity (in meters per second).\n*   $t$ is the time taken (in seconds).\n*   $a$ is the acceleration due to gravity (in meters per second squared).\n\nIn this case:\n*   The feather and hammer are dropped from rest, so the initial velocity ($v_0$) is 0 m/s.\n*   The distance ($d$) is 2 meters.\n*   The acceleration ($a$) is the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon.\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is approximately $1.625 \\, \\text{m/s}^2$.\n\nSince $v_0 = 0$, the equation simplifies to:\n$d = \\frac{1}{2} a t^2$\n\nTo find the time ($t$), we can rearrange the formula:\n$t^2 = \\frac{2d}{a}$\n$t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2d}{a}}$\n\n### Calculation\n\nNow, let's plug in the values:\n*   $d = 2 \\, \\text{m}$\n*   $a = 1.625 \\, \\text{m/s}^2$\n\n### Python Code for Calculation\n\nI will use Python's `math` module to perform the square root calculation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\ndistance = 2.0  # meters\nacceleration_moon = 1.625  # m/s^2\n\n# Calculate the time using the formula t = sqrt(2d/a)\ntime_to_fall = math.sqrt((2 * distance) / acceleration_moon)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The time it takes for the feather and hammer to fall 2 meters on the Moon is: {time_to_fall:.4f} seconds\")\n```\n\n**Result:**\n```\nThe time it takes for the feather and hammer to fall 2 meters on the Moon is: 1.5689 seconds\n```",
