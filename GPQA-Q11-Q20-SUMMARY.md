# GPQA Questions 11-20 - Extraction Summary

## Manual Verification Complete ✅

All 10 questions have been extracted and manually verified. The correct answers have been randomized to different positions (not always A).

### Quick Reference - Correct Answers:

1. **Q11 (Molecular Biology)**: C - CHIP-seq, chromosome conformation capture, and qRT-PCR
2. **Q12 (Chemistry)**: A - pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3
3. **Q13 (Quantum Mechanics)**: A - (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))
4. **Q14 (Quantum Mechanics)**: D - E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)
5. **Q15 (Genetics)**: D - A double crossover event
6. **Q16 (High-energy particle physics)**: D - 1 and 4
7. **Q17 (High-energy particle physics)**: C - 2.6*1e5 GeV
8. **Q18 (Genetics)**: C - G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3
9. **Q19 (Chemistry)**: B - 0.72 g
10. **Q20 (Organic Chemistry)**: C - triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

### Category Distribution:

### Files Created:
1. `gpqa-q11-q20-extracted.json` - Initial extraction (all answers as A)
2. `gpqa-q11-q20-randomized.json` - Final version with randomized answer positions

### Key Notes:
- The GPQA dataset CSV always lists the correct answer first, but for proper testing, answers have been randomized
- All questions contain complex technical content requiring expert knowledge
- Questions span multiple scientific domains
- Each question has been manually verified for completeness and correctness
