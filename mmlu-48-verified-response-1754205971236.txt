As Dr. Evelyn Reed, a Senior Computer Scientist specializing in Algorithm Analysis, I can definitively analyze this pseudocode and determine the value of `result`.

The provided pseudocode is as follows:

```pseudocode
result ← 0
REPEAT 3 TIMES {
  REPEAT y TIMES {
    result ← result + 1
  }
}
```

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the `result` variable changes:

1.  **Initialization:** The variable `result` is initialized to `0`.

2.  **Outer Loop:** The `REPEAT 3 TIMES` loop dictates that the entire block of code within it will execute exactly three times.

3.  **Inner Loop:** Inside the outer loop, there is another loop: `REPEAT y TIMES`. This inner loop will execute `y` times for *each* iteration of the outer loop.

4.  **Innermost Operation:** Within the inner loop, the statement `result ← result + 1` is executed. This means that for every single iteration of the inner loop, the `result` variable is incremented by `1`.

Let's trace the execution:

*   **Outer Loop Iteration 1:** The inner loop runs `y` times. Each time, `result` is incremented by 1. So, after the first iteration of the outer loop, `result` will be `0 + y * 1 = y`.
*   **Outer Loop Iteration 2:** The inner loop runs `y` times again. `result` is incremented by 1 for each of these `y` times. So, `result` becomes `y + y * 1 = 2y`.
*   **Outer Loop Iteration 3:** The inner loop runs `y` times for the third time. `result` is incremented by 1 for each of these `y` times. So, `result` becomes `2y + y * 1 = 3y`.

After the outer loop completes its three iterations, the final value of `result` will be `3y`.

The web search results confirm this understanding. For instance, result [7] states, "The program adds the positive integer 'y' to the variable 'result' three times, resulting in 'result' being equal to 3 times 'y'." Similarly, result [9] asks what the value of `result` is after the given pseudocode, implying a direct relationship.

Therefore, the expression that best describes the result of running this program code is `3y`.

Looking at the options provided:
(A) 3y

**My final answer is (A) 3y.**
