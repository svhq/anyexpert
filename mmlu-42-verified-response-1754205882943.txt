As Professor Anya Sharma, a specialist in Abstract Algebra, I have thoroughly analyzed both statements based on established theorems in abstract algebra.

**Statement 1: $\mathbb{R}$ is a splitting field of some polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$.**

A splitting field of a polynomial $p(x)$ over a field $F$ is the smallest field extension $K$ of $F$ such that $p(x)$ factors into linear factors over $K$. This implies that $K$ contains all the roots of $p(x)$. For $\mathbb{R}$ to be a splitting field of some polynomial $p(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$, $\mathbb{R}$ must be an algebraic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. This means every element in $\mathbb{R}$ must be a root of some polynomial with rational coefficients.

However, we know that the field of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ contains transcendental numbers, such as $\pi$ and $e$. A transcendental number is, by definition, not algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$, meaning it is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients. Since $\mathbb{R}$ contains elements that are not algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$ cannot be an algebraic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. Consequently, $\mathbb{R}$ cannot be a splitting field of any polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$.

Furthermore, the field of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable. If $\mathbb{R}$ were a splitting field of a polynomial $p(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$, then $\mathbb{R}$ would be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}$, specifically $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)$, where $\alpha_i$ are the roots of $p(x)$. Any finite extension of a countable field is also countable. However, $\mathbb{R}$ is an uncountable field. This contradiction confirms that $\mathbb{R}$ cannot be a splitting field of a polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$.

**Conclusion for Statement 1:** Statement 1 is False.

**Statement 2: There is a field with 60 elements.**

A fundamental theorem in the theory of finite fields states that a finite field with $q$ elements exists if and only if $q$ is a prime power, i.e., $q = p^n$ for some prime number $p$ and a positive integer $n$ [1].

To determine if a field with 60 elements exists, we must check if 60 can be expressed as a prime power. We find the prime factorization of 60:
$60 = 2 \times 30 = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5$.

The prime factorization of 60 includes three distinct prime factors: 2, 3, and 5. For a number to be a prime power, its prime factorization must consist of only one prime base. Since 60 has multiple prime factors, it is not a prime power.

Therefore, according to the theorem on the existence of finite fields, a field with 60 elements does not exist.

**Conclusion for Statement 2:** Statement 2 is False.

**Final Answer Determination:**
Based on the analysis, Statement 1 is False and Statement 2 is False.

Comparing these conclusions with the provided options:
(A) Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is Not Given
(B) Statement 1 is Not Given, Statement 2 is False
(C) True, False
(D) Both Statements are True and False respectively
(E) True, True
(F) Statement 1 is Not Given, Statement 2 is True
(G) False, True
(H) False, False
(I) Statement 1 is False, Statement 2 is Not Given
(J) Both statements are Not Given

Our findings align with option (H).

The final answer is $\boxed{H}$.
