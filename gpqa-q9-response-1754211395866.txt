I am Dr. Eleanor Vance, an organic chemist specializing in reaction mechanisms and stereochemistry. I can certainly help you determine the cycloaddition products for these reactions.

The question describes two thermal cycloaddition reactions, which are characteristic of the Diels-Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition. The general mechanism involves a conjugated diene reacting with a dienophile to form a six-membered ring.

Let's analyze each reaction to determine the products A and B.

**Reaction A: (E)-penta-1,3-diene + acrylonitrile ---> A**

This is a Diels-Alder reaction between a conjugated diene, (E)-penta-1,3-diene, and a dienophile, acrylonitrile.

1.  **Identify the Diene and Dienophile:**
    *   **Diene:** (E)-penta-1,3-diene. Its structure is CH₃-CH=CH-CH=CH₂. The 'E' configuration refers to the stereochemistry around the double bond between C2 and C3.
    *   **Dienophile:** Acrylonitrile. Its structure is CH₂=CH-CN. The nitrile group (-CN) is electron-withdrawing, making acrylonitrile an electron-poor dienophile [1].

2.  **Determine the Regiochemistry:** In the Diels-Alder reaction between an electron-rich diene and an electron-poor dienophile, the regiochemistry is governed by frontier molecular orbital (FMO) interactions, which generally lead to the formation of the most stable product. For this specific reaction, the terminal carbon of the diene (C1) typically bonds with the less substituted carbon of the dienophile (CH₂), and the other end of the diene (C4) bonds with the more substituted carbon of the dienophile (CH) [2].
    *   Let's number the diene as: CH₃(C5)-CH(C4)=CH(C3)-CH(C2)=CH₂(C1).
    *   The dienophile is CH₂(Cα)=CH(Cβ)-CN.
    *   The bond formation will occur between C1(diene) and Cα(dienophile), and C4(diene) and Cβ(dienophile).
    *   The methyl group is attached to C4 of the diene system. In the resulting six-membered ring, this carbon will become C5.
    *   The nitrile group is attached to Cβ of the dienophile, which bonds to C4 of the diene. This means the nitrile group will be on C1 of the cyclohexene ring.
    *   Therefore, the regiochemistry leads to the methyl group at position 5 and the nitrile group at position 1 of the cyclohexene ring.

3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific, meaning the stereochemistry of the starting materials is retained in the product. The addition is *syn* [3].
    *   The diene is (E)-penta-1,3-diene. The methyl group and the vinyl group (CH=CH₂) are on opposite sides of the C2-C3 double bond.
    *   The dienophile, acrylonitrile, is unsubstituted on the double bond.
    *   The reaction forms a cyclohexene ring. The *syn* addition means that the relative stereochemistry between the atoms in the diene and dienophile is maintained. The methyl group on C5 will be on one side of the ring, and the hydrogen atoms on C1 and C2 will be oriented in a specific way.
    *   The product is a cyclohex-3-ene ring. The double bond will be between C3 and C4.
    *   The methyl group is at position 5. The nitrile group is at position 1. The double bond is between positions 3 and 4.
    *   The structure is **5-methylcyclohex-3-ene-1-carbonitrile**.

**Reaction B: Cyclopentadiene + methyl acrylate (Heat) ---> B**

This is a Diels-Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and methyl acrylate.

1.  **Identify the Diene and Dienophile:**
    *   **Diene:** Cyclopentadiene. This is a cyclic diene and is highly reactive in Diels-Alder reactions [4].
    *   **Dienophile:** Methyl acrylate. Its structure is CH₂=CH-COOCH₃. The ester group (-COOCH₃) is electron-withdrawing, making it an electron-poor dienophile [1].

2.  **Determine the Regiochemistry:** Cyclopentadiene is symmetrical, so regiochemistry is not a determining factor in the orientation of the dienophile.

3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction involving cyclopentadiene and an electron-poor dienophile is known to be highly *endo* selective under kinetic control. This means the dienophile approaches the diene from the face that allows the electron-withdrawing group (ester in this case) to be oriented towards the developing double bond in the product, resulting in an *endo* stereochemistry [5].
    *   The reaction forms a bicyclic system, specifically a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.
    *   Cyclopentadiene reacts with methyl acrylate to form methyl bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylate.
    *   The *endo* addition means that the ester group (-COOCH₃) is oriented *under* the bridge (the C7 atom) of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.
    *   The specific stereochemistry of the *endo* adduct formed from the reaction of cyclopentadiene with methyl acrylate is known to be methyl (1R,2R,4R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylate or its enantiomer. The question provides specific absolute configurations.
    *   In the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system, C1 and C4 are bridgehead carbons. C2 and C3 are the carbons that bear the substituents from the dienophile. The ester is on C2. C7 is the bridging carbon.
    *   The *endo* position of the ester group at C2 means it is syn to the C7 bridge. Careful analysis of stereochemical conventions and models for the *endo* adduct of cyclopentadiene and methyl acrylate shows that the configuration corresponding to the *endo* product is **methyl (1R,2R,4R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylate** [6]. The alternative (1R,2S,4R) would typically correspond to the *exo* adduct or a different enantiomer if the dienophile approach was reversed.

**Summary of Products:**
*   Product A: 5-methylcyclohex-3-ene-1-carbonitrile
*   Product B: methyl (1R,2R,4R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylate

Comparing these with the given options:
*   Option A: A = 5-methylcyclohex-3-ene-1-carbonitrile, B = methyl (1R,2R,4R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylate. This matches our findings.
*   Option B: A = cyclohexa-2,4-diene-1-carbonitrile, B = methyl (1R,2R,4R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylate. The structure for A is incorrect.
*   Option C: A = 5-methylcyclohex-3-ene-1-carbonitrile, B = methyl (1R,2S,4R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylate. The stereochemistry for B is incorrect.
*   Option D: A = cyclohexa-2,4-diene-1-carbonitrile, B = methyl (1R,2S,4R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylate. Both A and B are incorrect.

Therefore, option A correctly identifies both products based on the principles of Diels-Alder reactions, regiochemistry, and stereochemistry.
