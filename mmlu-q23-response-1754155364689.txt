As Dr. Evelyn Reed, a Senior Systems Analyst specializing in storage technologies, I can provide a detailed analysis of this disk occupancy problem.

The problem states that a 32-bit segment of a bit string represents the occupancy of disk tracks, where '1' signifies an occupied track and '0' signifies a vacant track. The given hexadecimal value for this 32-bit segment is D4FE2003. We need to determine the percentage of occupied tracks.

**1. Convert Hexadecimal to Binary:**
First, we must convert the hexadecimal value D4FE2003 into its binary equivalent. Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to 4 binary digits (bits):

*   D = 1101
*   4 = 0100
*   F = 1111
*   E = 1110
*   2 = 0010
*   0 = 0000
*   0 = 0000
*   3 = 0011

Concatenating these binary representations gives us the 32-bit string:
`1101 0100 1111 1110 0010 0000 0000 0011` [23]

**2. Count Occupied Tracks:**
The problem defines '1' as an occupied track [4]. We need to count the number of '1's in the binary string obtained above.

*   From `1101 0100 1111 1110 0010 0000 0000 0011`:
    *   The first group `1101` has 3 ones.
    *   The second group `0100` has 1 one.
    *   The third group `1111` has 4 ones.
    *   The fourth group `1110` has 3 ones.
    *   The fifth group `0010` has 1 one.
    *   The sixth group `0000` has 0 ones.
    *   The seventh group `0000` has 0 ones.
    *   The eighth group `0011` has 2 ones.

Total number of occupied tracks (number of '1's) = 3 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 14 [2, 3]

**3. Calculate Percentage of Occupied Tracks:**
The total number of tracks represented by the 32-bit segment is 32. The percentage of occupied tracks is calculated as:

Percentage Occupied = (Number of Occupied Tracks / Total Tracks) \* 100

Percentage Occupied = (14 / 32) \* 100

**4. Perform the Calculation:**
(14 / 32) \* 100 = 0.4375 \* 100 = 43.75%

**5. Round to the Nearest Percent:**
The question asks for the percentage to the nearest percent. Rounding 43.75% to the nearest whole number gives us 44%.

Therefore, the percentage of occupied tracks for the corresponding part of the disk is approximately 44%.

The final answer is **(D) 44%**
