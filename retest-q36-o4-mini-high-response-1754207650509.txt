After reviewing the virology, nomenclature and disease spectrum of polyomaviruses, the overwhelming evidence is that these viruses are primarily tumor‐inducing, especially in classic animal models. Below is a concise, step-by-step rationale:

1. Nomenclature  
   • “Polyomavirus” derives from Greek poly (“many”) + oma (“tumor”), coined because infection of susceptible rodents produces multiple tumor types [1].  

2. Animal‐model pathology  
   • In mice, hamsters and other small mammals, experimental inoculation with polyomavirus reliably transforms infected cells, leading to both benign and malignant neoplasms in diverse organs (skin, liver, mammary glands, etc.) [2].  

3. Human infections  
   • The two best‐characterized human polyomaviruses, JC virus (JCV) and BK virus (BKV), establish lifelong, largely asymptomatic infections in immunocompetent hosts.  
   • Disease manifestations in humans are uncommon and typically occur only in immunosuppressed individuals:  
     – JCV → progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML; demyelinating brain disease) [3]  
     – BKV → nephropathy in renal transplant recipients [4]  
   • These rare clinical syndromes notwithstanding, human polyomaviruses do not generally present as tumors in natural infection.  

4. Predominant phenotype  
   • The defining—and experimentally most robust—feature of polyomaviruses is their oncogenic potential demonstrated across animal species.  
   • In humans, overt tumor formation by JCV or BKV is not a recognized clinical entity, whereas tumors are the hallmark in laboratory models.  

Conclusion: Polyomaviruses predominantly cause tumours.  
Answer: A) Tumours
