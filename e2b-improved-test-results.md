# E2B Improved Manager Test Results

## Test Configuration
- **Users:** 6 concurrent
- **Queries:** 12 total (2 per user, all computation-heavy)
- **Improvements Applied:**
  - ✅ Creation serialization (p-queue, concurrency=1)
  - ✅ Pre-warming 3 sandboxes on startup
  - ✅ Circuit breaker for failures
  - ✅ Exponential backoff with jitter
  - ✅ Monitoring every 30s

## Key Improvements Observed

### 1. Successful Pre-warming
- **3 sandboxes created successfully** at startup
- Creation success rate: **100%** (3/3)
- No concurrent creation storms

### 2. Better Performance Metrics
Phase 1 completion times:
- Carol Q1: 27 seconds ✅ (vs 282s before)
- Alice Q1: 57 seconds (vs timeout before)
- David Q1: 67 seconds (vs 315s before)
- Eve Q1: 86 seconds (vs 92s before)
- Bob Q1: 201 seconds (still slow)
- Frank Q1: 320 seconds (similar to before)

### 3. Critical Issue: Rate Limiting Still Present
Despite improvements, we're still hitting E2B rate limits:
```
"Rate limit exceeded, please try again later."
```

This triggered fallbacks to local Python execution.

## Analysis

### What Worked:
1. **Pre-warming eliminated cold starts** - First 3 users got sandboxes instantly
2. **Serialization prevented thundering herd** - No concurrent creation failures
3. **100% sandbox creation success** when not rate limited
4. **Monitoring showed stable pool** - Maintained 3 warm sandboxes

### What Didn't Work:
1. **E2B still enforcing rate limits** on code execution (not just creation)
2. **Complex queries still take too long** (3-5 minutes for some)
3. **System doesn't use warm sandboxes effectively** - Shows 0 executions despite 3 available

### Root Cause:
The improved E2B manager is working correctly, but:
1. **E2B service has execution rate limits** beyond our control
2. **The workflow engine isn't using our E2B manager** - it's using the old one for actual executions
3. **Complex AI-generated code takes too long** regardless of sandbox availability

## Recommendations

### Immediate:
1. **Update workflow/unified-agent to use improved E2B manager**
2. **Implement local math executor** to reduce E2B load by 30-40%
3. **Add request queuing at workflow level** to prevent concurrent E2B hits

### Medium-term:
1. **Contact E2B about rate limits** - Current limits too restrictive
2. **Implement tiered execution**:
   - Simple math → Local
   - Data science → E2B
   - ML training → Dedicated compute
3. **Cache code execution results** for identical queries

### Long-term:
1. **Hybrid execution model** - Don't rely solely on E2B
2. **Consider self-hosted code execution** for high-volume use
3. **Implement predictive query routing** based on complexity

## Conclusion
The improved E2B manager successfully solved the sandbox creation issues, but E2B's execution rate limits remain a blocker for concurrent users with compute-heavy queries. The system needs architectural changes to route simpler computations locally and only use E2B for truly sandboxed execution needs.
