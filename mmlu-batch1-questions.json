      "question": "Which of the following compounds would be expected to have the highest boiling point?",
      "options": [
        "A) CH₃CH₂CH₃ (propane)",
        "B) CH₃CH₂CH₂OH (1-propanol)",
        "C) CH₃OCH₃ (dimethyl ether)",
        "D) CH₃CH₂F (fluoroethane)"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "1-propanol has hydrogen bonding due to the -OH group, giving it the highest boiling point"
