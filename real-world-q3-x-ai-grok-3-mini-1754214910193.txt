### Comprehensive Answer to Your Query

Thank you for providing your details—age 28, $50,000 in savings, and a retirement goal at age 55 (a 27-year horizon)—along with the web search results. I'll address your question step by step: whether to prioritize maxing out a 401(k), opening a Roth IRA, or investing in index funds, and how to balance these with current inflation rates. As a financial planner, I prioritize strategies that maximize compounding growth, minimize taxes, and protect against inflation's erosive effects, based on established principles like those from the search results.

#### Step 1: Assess Your Overall Situation
Let's begin with first-principles thinking: evaluate your starting point and goals to build a logical foundation.
- **Your Profile:** At 28, you have a significant advantage with time on your side, allowing for aggressive growth-oriented investments. Your $50,000 savings is a solid base, potentially representing 1-2 years of targeted retirement contributions (as suggested by results like [7] from Fidelity, which recommends saving 15% of income annually). Retiring at 55 means you need to aim for a portfolio that grows substantially—rule of thumb from [17] and [35] (Get Rich Slowly) suggests targeting 70-80% of pre-retirement income for expenses, so plan for inflation-adjusted growth.
- **Inflation Context:** Current inflation (as of 2025) is around 2-4%, per general economic data (e.g., [15] from GovInfo). Over 27 years, this could erode your savings' purchasing power—e.g., $50,000 today might be worth only about $28,000 in real terms at 3% annual inflation. Investments must outpace this; historically, stocks in index funds have delivered 7-10% nominal returns, netting 4-7% after inflation, as noted in results like [23] and [29] (NerdWallet).
- **Key Principle:** Prioritize accounts that offer tax advantages and high growth, then allocate based on contribution limits and employer benefits. From the search results (e.g., [9], [14], and [20]), starting early with a mix of tax-deferred and tax-free accounts is crucial for early retirees like you.

#### Step 2: Evaluate and Prioritize Your Options
Based on the search results, I'll break down each option using a step-by-step comparison, focusing on tax implications, contribution limits for 2025, and how they interact with inflation.

- **Option 1: Maxing Out a 401(k)**
  - **Why It's a Top Priority:** A 401(k) provides tax-deferred growth, meaning contributions (up to $23,000 in 2025) reduce your taxable income now, and earnings grow tax-free until withdrawal. If your employer offers a match (as highlighted in [16] from Pennsylvania Treasury and [20] from Reddit), contribute at least enough to capture it—it's free money that boosts your returns. For someone your age, this aligns with results like [14] (Quora), which emphasize early contributions for compounding.
  - **Inflation Balance:** This account helps in inflationary environments by allowing more upfront savings, but remember, withdrawals are taxed as income, potentially at higher rates if inflation pushes up taxes. A stock-heavy allocation within the 401(k) can counter inflation, as per [3] (Investopedia).
  - **Pros and Cons:** Pros include high limits and employer matches; cons include penalties for early withdrawals and future tax uncertainty. From [10] (Archer), it's ideal if you have access, but don't overlook liquidity needs.
  - **Recommendation for You:** Prioritize this first if a match is available. For example, if your salary is $60,000, aim to contribute 15-20% ($9,000-$12,000) initially, drawing from your $50,000 savings.

- **Option 2: Opening a Roth IRA**
  - **Why It's Next:** After securing a 401(k) match, a Roth IRA (with a 2025 limit of $7,000) offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is advantageous if you expect higher future taxes or inflation-driven income growth. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars (no upfront deduction, as per [6] from Thrivent), but the tax-free growth is a hedge against inflation. Results like [5] (Quora) and [38] recommend this for young investors, especially after maxing a 401(k).
  - **Inflation Balance:** Roth IRAs provide flexibility—e.g., you can withdraw contributions penalty-free if needed—and protect against rising taxes during inflation. This makes it a strong complement to a 401(k), as noted in [4] (NerdWallet).
  - **Pros and Cons:** Pros include tax-free growth and no required minimum distributions until age 73; cons include income phase-out limits ($146,000 for single filers in 2025). If you're over the limit, consider a backdoor Roth conversion, as discussed in [32].
  - **Recommendation for You:** Fund this after your 401(k). With $50,000 saved, allocate up to $7,000 here for 2025, prioritizing it for its long-term tax benefits.

- **Option 3: Investing in Index Funds**
  - **Why It's a Supplement:** Once tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, invest in low-cost index funds (e.g., via a taxable brokerage account). These provide broad market exposure (e.g., S&P 500 funds with fees under 0.10%, as in [23] and [29]), historically outpacing inflation. From [14] and [22] (Financial Planning article), this is key for early investors to leverage compounding.
  - **Inflation Balance:** Index funds, especially stock-focused ones, are effective against inflation due to their growth potential. Aim for an 80% stock/20% bond allocation now, rebalancing as you approach 55 (per [3]). In a taxable account, you'll pay taxes on gains annually, so use this for excess funds.
  - **Pros and Cons:** Pros include diversification and liquidity; cons include annual taxes on gains, which could reduce returns during high inflation. Results like [29] list this as a top option for a $50,000 investment.
  - **Recommendation for You:** Use remaining funds (e.g., after 401(k) and Roth contributions) for index funds. This could mean investing $20,000-$30,000 of your savings here initially.

#### Step 3: Balancing with Inflation
Inflation is a critical factor, as it can undermine your goals if not addressed. From [15] and economic principles, aim for investments with real returns (after inflation) of 4-7%. Here's how to integrate it:
- **Asset Allocation Strategy:** Start with a growth-focused portfolio (e.g., 80-90% in stocks via index funds, 10-20% in bonds or inflation-protected assets like TIPS). Rebalance annually—e.g., if inflation exceeds 4%, slightly increase stock exposure for higher returns, as suggested in [30] (J.P. Morgan guide).
- **Savings Rate:** Target 15-20% of your income annually, per [7] and [22]. With $50,000 saved, this could grow to approximately $250,000 by 55 at a 7% return and 3% inflation, assuming consistent contributions (a rough estimate based on compounding formulas).
- **Risk Management:** Diversify across accounts to mitigate inflation risks—e.g., use your 401(k) for core growth, Roth IRA for tax-free flexibility, and index funds for liquidity. Monitor economic indicators via sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and adjust as needed.

#### Step 4: Recommended Prioritization and Action Plan
Based on the analysis and search results, here's a clear, prioritized plan:
1. **Maximize 401(k) First:** Contribute up to the employer match (e.g., 6% of salary), then up to the $23,000 limit if possible. This leverages tax deferral and free money ([16], [20]).
2. **Fund a Roth IRA Next:** Contribute up to $7,000 for tax-free growth ([5], [38]).
3. **Invest Excess in Index Funds:** Place any remaining savings (e.g., $20,000 of your $50,000) into a taxable account with low-cost funds ([23], [29]).
4. **Overall Allocation Example:** For your $50,000:
   - 40-50% ($20,000-$25,000) to 401(k) contributions.
   - 15-20% ($7,000-$10,000) to Roth IRA.
   - 30-45% ($15,000-$25,000) to index funds.
5. **Inflation-Adjusted Monitoring:** Save 15-20% of income yearly, rebalance annually, and use tools like the Fidelity calculator ([7]) for projections.

This plan draws from sources such as [7], [14], [23], and [29] for evidence. If you'd like, I can execute a Python simulation (using NumPy) to model your portfolio's growth under different inflation scenarios—e.g., provide your annual income, and I'll run the code in my next response.

### Final Recommendations
Yes, you should prioritize maxing your 401(k) (especially for an employer match), followed by opening and funding a Roth IRA, then investing in index funds. This balances tax advantages, growth, and inflation protection, positioning you for a comfortable retirement at 55. Start by calculating your exact savings rate and consulting a financial advisor for personalized tweaks.
