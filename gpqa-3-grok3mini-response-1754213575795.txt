As Dr. Emily Rivera, Professor of Organic Chemistry at Stanford University, with decades of expertise in reaction mechanisms, synthetic organic chemistry, and molecular structure analysis, I am pleased to address this query on the multi-step synthesis starting from trans-cinnamaldehyde. I'll draw on first-principles reasoning to analyze the reaction sequence, predict the structures, and determine the number of carbon atoms in product 3, while cross-referencing the provided web search results for verification.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
To answer accurately, let's break down the reaction sequence using established chemical principles. I'll predict the products based on the mechanisms involved and track the carbon count at each step.

1. **Starting Material: Trans-Cinnamaldehyde**  
   - Structure: C6H5-CH=CH-CHO (a benzene ring attached to a trans double bond and an aldehyde group).  
   - Molecular formula: C9H8O (9 carbon atoms).  

2. **Step 1: Reaction with Methylmagnesium Bromide (CH3MgBr)**  
   - This is a classic Grignard addition to the aldehyde carbonyl. The nucleophilic CH3- group attacks the electrophilic C=O, forming a secondary alcohol after aqueous workup.  
   - Resulting Product 1: C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH3.  
   - Molecular formula: C10H12O (adding the CH3 group from the Grignard reagent to the original C9H8O, with hydrogen adjustments for alcohol formation).  
   - Carbon count: 10 atoms (9 from trans-cinnamaldehyde + 1 from CH3).  

3. **Step 2: Reaction with Pyridinium Chlorochromate (PCC)**  
   - PCC selectively oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones. Here, the -CH(OH)CH3 group in Product 1 is oxidized to -C(O)CH3.  
   - Resulting Product 2: C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH3.  
   - Molecular formula: C10H10O (from C10H12O, losing two hydrogens during oxidation).  
   - Carbon count: Still 10 atoms (no carbons are added or removed).  

4. **Step 3: Reaction with (Dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at Elevated Temperature**  
   - This reagent is dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, used in the Corey-Chaikovsky reaction, which converts ketones to epoxides by adding a CH2 group across the carbonyl.  
   - The ylide reacts with the ketone in Product 2, forming an epoxide (e.g., C6H5-CH=CH-C(O)CH2 as a cyclopropane oxide derivative).  
   - Resulting Product 3: An epoxide with the formula C11H12O (adding a CH2 unit to C10H10O).  
   - Carbon count: 11 atoms (10 from Product 2 + 1 from the CH2 group added in the epoxidation).  

This step-by-step reasoning aligns with fundamental organic chemistry principles, such as nucleophilic addition, selective oxidation, and ylide-based epoxidation. To verify, I consulted the provided web search results, particularly [1], which explicitly states that product 3 has 11 carbon atoms, matching my analysis. The other results ([2]–[7]) discuss related mechanisms like Grignard reactions and oxidations but do not provide contradictory details.

### Final Answer
Based on the detailed analysis, product 3 has **11 carbon atoms**.

**Selected Option: A) 11**
