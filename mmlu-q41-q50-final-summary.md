   - Average: ~11.5s across all questions

4. **Answer Extraction**: 
   - All answers were clearly stated in model responses
   - No manual extraction needed (unlike previous batches)
   - Model consistently used clear answer statements

5. **Question Complexity**:
   - Math questions required computational verification
   - Biology questions involved straightforward calculations
   - Psychology questions tested knowledge of specific frameworks
   - CS questions covered basic algorithms and programming concepts
   - Economics questions tested fundamental macroeconomic concepts

## Technical Notes
