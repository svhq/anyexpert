As Dr. Evelyn Reed, an astrophysicist specializing in planetary science, I have reviewed the provided research and analysis regarding the first accurate measurement of Pluto's diameter.

The question asks for the method used for the *first accurate determination* of Pluto's diameter. Based on the evidence presented in the search results, the most compelling method identified for achieving this accuracy is through observations of mutual eclipses or occultations between Pluto and its moon, Charon.

Specifically, search result [1] states: "For the first time, an accurate and direct determination of the diameters of the outermost planet Pluto and its moon, Charon, has been made. On the basis of measurements of light changes during eclipses, Pluto was found to have a diameter of 2200Â±140 km." This directly links the accurate measurement to "measurements of light changes during eclipses."

Further supporting this, search results [2] and [33] mention, "Observations of Pluto in occultation with Charon allowed scientists to establish Pluto's diameter more accurately." The discovery of Charon in 1978 (as noted in [9]) provided a crucial new opportunity for these precise measurements. Search results [13] and [17] also discuss the method of observing stellar occultations by Pluto as a means to determine its dimensions.

While other methods and missions have contributed to our understanding of Pluto's size, including the New Horizons mission which provided highly accurate measurements (approximately 2,370 km, as per [23] and [40]), the wording "first accurate determination" points to the earlier breakthroughs. Gerard Kuiper's 1950 measurements using the 200-inch telescope [6, 38] provided estimates of apparent diameter, but the "first accurate and direct determination" appears to be linked to the Pluto-Charon mutual events.

Considering the options provided:
*   (A) Lunar-based observations made during NASA's Apollo missions: Apollo missions were focused on the Moon, not Pluto.
*   (B) The Voyager 2 spacecraft flyby in the 1980s: Voyager 2 did not fly by Pluto.
*   (C) Observations made by the Chandra X-ray Observatory: Chandra is an X-ray telescope, not suited for direct physical diameter measurements of planets.
*   (D) Brightness measurements made during mutual eclipses of Pluto and Charon: This is strongly supported by the search results as the method for the first accurate determination.
*   (E) The Mars Rover's telescope observations of Pluto: Mars rovers are on Mars and not equipped for such measurements of Pluto.
*   (F) Radar observations made by the Arecibo telescope: While Arecibo is capable of radar astronomy, the provided results do not highlight it as the *first* method for accurate Pluto diameter measurement.
*   (G) Observations made by the Spitzer Space Telescope: Spitzer was an infrared telescope; while useful for thermal properties, it's not cited for the *first* accurate diameter.
*   (H) Hubble Space Telescope images that resolved Pluto's disk: Hubble has provided valuable data, but the "mutual eclipses" method is cited as the *first* accurate determination.
*   (I) A New Horizons flyby in the 1990s: New Horizons flew by in 2015, and while it yielded precise measurements, it was not the *first* accurate determination.
*   (J) Images captured by the Kepler Space Telescope: Kepler was designed to find exoplanets and is not associated with the first accurate measurement of Pluto's diameter.

Therefore, the evidence overwhelmingly supports that the first accurate determination of Pluto's diameter was achieved through observations of mutual eclipses between Pluto and Charon.

The final answer is **(D) Brightness measurements made during mutual eclipses of Pluto and Charon**.
