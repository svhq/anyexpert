As Dr. Eleanor Vance, a cellular biologist specializing in plant development, I can confirm that the most likely source of mitotic cell divisions among the provided options is a **longitudinal section of a shoot tip**.

My analysis, consistent with established plant biology principles, highlights that mitotic cell division is most actively and continuously occurring in specific regions of plant growth known as meristems. The **apical meristems**, located at the tips of shoots and roots, are the primary drivers of primary growth, responsible for increasing the plant's length and producing new organs like leaves and flowers.

Let's briefly reiterate why the shoot tip is the optimal choice:

*   **Shoot Tip (Apical Meristem):** This region is characterized by actively dividing, undifferentiated cells that are constantly undergoing mitosis to generate new cells for shoot elongation and the formation of leaf and floral primordia [1]. Observing this region longitudinally provides a clear view of these meristematic cells in various stages of mitosis.

In contrast, the other options are less likely to exhibit widespread mitotic activity:

*   **(A) Muscle tissue:** This is animal tissue, and while repair can involve cell division, it's not a primary site of growth through mitosis in the context of plant development.
*   **(C) Leaf vein:** Vascular tissues are differentiated and primarily involved in transport, with limited mitotic activity for maintenance.
*   **(D) Fruit:** While cell division occurs during early fruit development, mature fruit tissues primarily rely on cell expansion.
*   **(E) Leaf:** Mature leaf cells are differentiated and generally do not undergo mitosis.
*   **(F) Petal:** Petals are specialized structures that develop through cell expansion and differentiation.
*   **(G) Seed:** A mature seed contains quiescent embryonic cells; active mitosis is only prominent during germination.
*   **(H) Anther:** While mitosis is involved in the development of pollen mother cells, the key process here is meiosis, and meristems are more consistently active sites of mitosis for overall growth.

Therefore, based on the fundamental processes of plant growth and cell division, a longitudinal section of a shoot tip would provide the most abundant and characteristic examples of mitotic cell divisions.

The final answer is **(B) longitudinal section of a shoot tip**.
