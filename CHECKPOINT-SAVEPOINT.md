## 🔧 **Quick Start Guide**

### Basic Usage (Ready Now):
```bash
# Start the system
node index.js

# Example queries:
# "What is the derivative of x³ + 2x² - 5x?"
# "Analyze the correlation in this dataset: [1,2,3,4,5]"
# "Explain how to implement binary search in Python"
```

### Advanced Capabilities (Requires Template Build):
```bash
# Build advanced template
cd microservices/run-code
./build-template.sh

# Add template ID to .env
echo "E2B_TEMPLATE_ID=tpl_xxxxxxxx" >> ../../.env

# Restart system for advanced libraries
```
