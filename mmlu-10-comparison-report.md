## Key Insights

### 1. **Accuracy Gap**
- o4-mini-high demonstrated significantly superior accuracy (90% vs 50%)
- GLM-4.5-air struggled particularly with Psychology questions (0/2)
- Both models excelled at Business questions (100%)

### 2. **Response Times**
- GLM-4.5-air was generally faster (avg 18.3s vs 21.4s)
- Exception: When GLM used web search (Q2), it took 51.3s
- o4-mini-high maintained consistent timing across all questions

### 3. **Error Patterns**
- **GLM-4.5-air**: Failed on more nuanced questions requiring deeper understanding
- **Both models**: Struggled with the psychology ethics question (Q6)
- **GLM answer extraction**: Failed completely on Q5 (no answer detected)

### 4. **Cost-Performance Trade-off**
- o4-mini-high: ~$0.0055 per question for 90% accuracy
- GLM-4.5-air: FREE for 50% accuracy
- **40% accuracy improvement costs ~$0.055 for 10 questions**

## Recommendations

1. **For Production Use**: o4-mini-high is recommended for applications requiring high accuracy
2. **For Development/Testing**: GLM-4.5-air provides adequate performance at zero cost
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Consider using GLM for simple queries and o4-mini-high for complex ones
4. **Answer Extraction**: Improve regex patterns for GLM responses which sometimes fail

## Conclusion

The o4-mini-high model justifies its cost with nearly double the accuracy of the free GLM-4.5-air model. However, for applications where 50% accuracy is acceptable or where cost is a primary concern, GLM-4.5-air remains a viable option. The choice depends on the specific use case requirements for accuracy versus cost.
