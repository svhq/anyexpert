      "question": "A state has recently enacted a statute requiring all prospective voters in state elections who wish to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name, and designate the office for which the candidate is running. The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials?",

        "D) It unreasonably discriminates against non-English speaking voters in general.",
        "E) It violates the Equal Protection Clause by treating write-in candidates differently.",
        "F) It unreasonably discriminates against write-in candidates for public office.",
        "G) It unreasonably limits the means by which a candidate can campaign, infringing on democratic practices.",
        "H) It unreasonably restricts freedom of speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment.",
        "I) It unreasonably interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act outlawing literacy tests.",
