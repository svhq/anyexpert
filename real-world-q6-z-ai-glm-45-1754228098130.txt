I'll address your question about finding all pairs in a list of 1 million integers that sum to a target value. Your current nested loop solution is indeed inefficient for this scale of data, so let me provide you with optimized approaches and implementations.

## Analysis of Current Approach

Your nested loop solution has a time complexity of O(n²), which means for 1 million integers, you're performing approximately 10¹² operations. This explains why it's taking 30+ seconds - it's computationally expensive [31, 32].

## Optimal Solution: Hash Set Approach

The most efficient algorithm for this problem is using a hash set (or dictionary) to store seen elements. This approach has O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity [9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 41].

Here's the implementation:

```python
def find_all_pairs(nums, target):
    """
    Find all pairs of integers in nums that sum to target.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of integers
        target: Target sum value
        
    Returns:
        List of tuples representing pairs that sum to target
    """
    # Create a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of each number
    freq = {}
    pairs = []
    
    # First pass: count frequencies
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Second pass: find pairs
    for num in nums:
        complement = target - num
        
        # Check if complement exists
        if complement in freq:
            # Handle case where num == complement
            if num == complement:
                # Need at least two occurrences of the same number
                if freq[num] >= 2:
                    pairs.append((num, complement))
                    # Decrement frequency to avoid duplicate pairs
                    freq[num] -= 2
            else:
                if freq[num] > 0 and freq[complement] > 0:
                    pairs.append((num, complement))
                    # Decrement frequencies to avoid duplicate pairs
                    freq[num] -= 1
                    freq[complement] -= 1
    
    return pairs
```

## Time Complexity Analysis

The hash set approach has:
- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - First pass through the list: O(n)
  - Second pass through the list: O(n)
  - Dictionary lookups are O(1) on average
  
- Space Complexity: O(n)
  - We need to store frequency counts for each unique number

This is a significant improvement over your current O(n²) solution. For 1 million integers, the optimized solution would be approximately 1 million times faster in theory [12, 13, 16, 18].

## Alternative Approach: Two-Pointer Technique

If memory usage is a concern, you could use the two-pointer technique, which has O(n log n) time complexity but only O(1) additional space (not counting the space for the result):

```python
def find_all_pairs_two_pointer(nums, target):
    """
    Find all pairs using two-pointer technique.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of integers
        target: Target sum value
        
    Returns:
        List of tuples representing pairs that sum to target
    """
    # Sort the array
    nums_sorted = sorted(nums)
    left = 0
    right = len(nums_sorted) - 1
    pairs = []
    
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums_sorted[left] + nums_sorted[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            pairs.append((nums_sorted[left], nums_sorted[right]))
            left += 1
            right -= 1
            # Skip duplicates
            while left < right and nums_sorted[left] == nums_sorted[left-1]:
                left += 1
            while left < right and nums_sorted[right] == nums_sorted[right+1]:
                right -= 1
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    
    return pairs
```

This approach has:
- Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting
- Space Complexity: O(1) additional space (not counting the space for the result) [24, 30, 48]

## Performance Comparison

Let's verify the performance with a quick test:

```python
import random
import time

# Generate a list of 1 million random integers
random.seed(42)
nums = [random.randint(1, 1000) for _ in range(1000000)]
target = 100

# Test hash set approach
start_time = time.time()
pairs = find_all_pairs(nums, target)
hash_set_time = time.time() - start_time

# Test two-pointer approach
start_time = time.time()
pairs_two_pointer = find_all_pairs_two_pointer(nums, target)
two_pointer_time = time.time() - start_time

print(f"Hash set approach found {len(pairs)} pairs in {hash_set_time:.4f} seconds")
print(f"Two-pointer approach found {len(pairs_two_pointer)} pairs in {two_pointer_time:.4f} seconds")
```

## Additional Optimizations

Depending on your specific requirements, you might consider these additional optimizations:

1. **Early Termination**: If you only need a certain number of pairs, you can modify the algorithm to stop once enough pairs are found.

2. **Parallel Processing**: For very large datasets, you could split the list and process chunks in parallel, then merge the results.

3. **Memory-Mapped Files**: If the dataset is too large for memory, you could use memory-mapped files or database solutions.

4. **Bitmask for Small Integers**: If your integers have a small range, you could use a bitmask instead of a hash table for even faster lookups.

## Conclusion

For your specific case of 1 million integers, the hash set approach is likely the best solution, offering O(n) time complexity. This should reduce your processing time from 30+ seconds to a fraction of a second. The implementation I've provided handles duplicates correctly and avoids returning duplicate pairs [9, 14, 16, 18, 41].

Remember that the actual performance may vary based on your specific hardware, the distribution of values in your list, and the target sum value. I recommend testing both approaches with your actual data to determine which works best for your specific case.
