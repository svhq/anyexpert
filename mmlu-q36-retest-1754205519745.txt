As Dr. Anya Sharma, a clinical virologist and infectious disease specialist, I can definitively answer your question.

Polyomaviruses are a ubiquitous group of viruses that infect a large percentage of the human population, often asymptomatically. However, when they do cause disease, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, they are associated with several distinct pathologies.

Let's evaluate the options based on current scientific understanding:

*   **(A) Tumours:** Certain polyomaviruses possess oncogenic properties. The most prominent example is the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), which is considered the primary etiological agent of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare but aggressive form of skin cancer [1]. Other polyomaviruses, such as the BK virus (BKV), have also been implicated in the development of certain urological malignancies, like urothelial carcinoma [2]. This direct link to cancer formation makes "tumours" a significant category of disease caused by polyomaviruses.

*   **(B) Brain pathology:** The John Cunningham virus (JCV), another member of the polyomavirus family, is well-known for causing Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a severe demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that typically occurs in individuals with profound cellular immunodeficiency, such as those with advanced HIV infection or on certain immunosuppressive therapies [3]. While devastating, PML is a specific neurological manifestation.

*   **(C) No disease at all:** While it is true that most polyomavirus infections are asymptomatic, this option fails to acknowledge the significant and often severe diseases that can arise when the virus does manifest pathologically, especially in vulnerable populations. Therefore, it does not represent the predominant disease *when disease occurs*.

*   **(D) Kidney infections:** The BK virus (BKV) is a major cause of complications in kidney transplant recipients. It can lead to BKV-associated nephropathy (BKVAN), a form of kidney disease that often results in graft dysfunction and failure [4]. This is a critical clinical issue in transplant medicine.

**Conclusion:**

When considering the spectrum of diseases caused by polyomaviruses, the oncogenic potential leading to **tumours** is a defining characteristic for several members of this viral family. While PML and BKV nephropathy are severe and clinically significant diseases, they are often opportunistic infections occurring in specific immunocompromised states. The direct causal link of viruses like MCPyV to cancers, and the broader association of other polyomaviruses with tumorigenesis, positions "tumours" as a predominant disease category caused by polyomaviruses.

The final answer is **(A) Tumours**.
