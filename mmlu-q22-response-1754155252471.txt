As Dr. Evelyn Reed, a seasoned mathematician specializing in number theory, I will analyze each of the given numbers to determine if they are greater than 1.

The numbers to evaluate are:
1.  $(0.8)^2$
2.  $(0.8)^{1/2}$
3.  $(1.2)^2$
4.  $(1.2)^{1/2}$

Let's evaluate each one:

### 1. $(0.8)^2$
When a number between 0 and 1 is squared, the result is smaller than the original number.
$(0.8)^2 = 0.8 \times 0.8 = 0.64$
Since $0.64 < 1$, this number is not greater than 1.

### 2. $(0.8)^{1/2}$
This is the square root of 0.8. The square root of any positive number less than 1 is also less than 1.
Using a calculator or computational tool:
$\sqrt{0.8} \approx 0.894427$ [37]
Since $0.894427 < 1$, this number is not greater than 1.

### 3. $(1.2)^2$
When a number greater than 1 is squared, the result is larger than the original number.
$(1.2)^2 = 1.2 \times 1.2 = 1.44$
Since $1.44 > 1$, this number is greater than 1.

### 4. $(1.2)^{1/2}$
This is the square root of 1.2. The square root of any number greater than 1 is also greater than 1.
Using a calculator or computational tool:
$\sqrt{1.2} \approx 1.095445$ [29, 33]
Since $1.095445 > 1$, this number is greater than 1.

### Conclusion
Out of the four numbers, $(1.2)^2$ and $(1.2)^{1/2}$ are greater than 1.

Therefore, there are **2** numbers greater than 1.

The final answer is $\boxed{2}$.
