Let me analyze these statements carefully.\n\n**Statement 1: The external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic.**\n\nThis statement is false. While the external direct product of cyclic groups can sometimes be cyclic, it's not always true. \n\nFor example, consider Z₂ × Z₂ (the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2). This group has four elements: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). No single element generates the entire group, as each non-identity element has order 2. This is the Klein four-group, which is not cyclic.\n\nThe external direct product Zₘ × Zₙ is cyclic if and only if gcd(m,n) = 1 (when m and n are coprime). For instance, Z₂ × Z₃ is cyclic because gcd(2,3) = 1, and it's isomorphic to Z₆.\n\n**Statement 2: The external direct product of D₃ and D₄ is isomorphic to D₁₂.**\n\nThis statement is also false. \n\nFirst, let's clarify the orders of these groups:\n- D₃ is the dihedral group of order 6 (symmetries of an equilateral triangle)\n- D₄ is the dihedral group of order 8 (symmetries of a square)\n- D₁₂ is the dihedral group of order 24 (symmetries of a regular 12-gon)\n\nThe external direct product D₃ × D₄ would have order |D₃| × |D₄| = 6 × 8 = 48.\n\nSince |D₃ × D₄| = 48 and |D₁₂| = 24, these groups have different orders. Groups of different orders cannot be isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, both statements are false.\n\nThe correct answer is **B) False, False**.",

Let me analyze this problem step by step.\n\nThe problem asks for the ground state energy of a particle of mass m in a one-dimensional potential V(x) = kx^4. This is a quantum mechanical system without an exact analytical solution, so I'll use the variational method to estimate the ground state energy.\n\nFor the variational method, I'll use a Gaussian trial wavefunction:\nψ(x) = (α/π)^(1/4) * e^(-αx²/2)\n\nThe expectation value of energy is:\n<E> = <T> + <V>\n\nWhere <T> is the kinetic energy expectation and <V> is the potential energy expectation.\n\nFor a Gaussian wavefunction:\n<T> = ℏ²α/(2m)\n<V> = k<x^4> = k * 3/(2α²) = 3k/(2α²)\n\nSo:\n<E> = ℏ²α/(2m) + 3k/(2α²)\n\nTo find the minimum energy, I take the derivative with respect to α and set it to zero:\nd<E>/dα = ℏ²/(2m) - 3k/α³ = 0\n\nSolving for α:\nℏ²/(2m) = 3k/α³\nα³ = 6mk/ℏ²\nα = (6mk/ℏ²)^(1/3)\n\nSubstituting back into the energy expression:\n<E> = ℏ²/(2m) * (6mk/ℏ²)^(1/3) + 3k/(2 * (6mk/ℏ²)^(2/3))\n\nFactoring out (ℏ²k/m)^(1/3):\n<E> = (ℏ²k/m)^(1/3) * [ (1/2) * 6^(1/3) + (3/2) * (1/6)^(2/3) ]\n\nSimplifying the expression in brackets:\n(1/2) * 6^(1/3) + (3/2) * 6^(-2/3) = 6^(-2/3) * [3 + 3/2] = 6^(-2/3) * 9/2\n\nSo:\n<E> = (ℏ²k/m)^(1/3) * 6^(-2/3) * 9/2\n    = (ℏ²k/m)^(1/3) * 9/(2 * 36^(1/3))\n\nNumerically evaluating:\n36^(1/3) ≈ 3.3019\n2 * 3.3019 ≈ 6.6038\n9 / 6.6038 ≈ 1.3629\n\nThus:\n<E> ≈ 1.3629 * (ℏ²k/m)^(1/3)\n\nComparing with the options:\nA) (3/4)(ℏ²k/m)^(1/3) ≈ 0.75 * (ℏ²k/m)^(1/3)\nB) (1/2)(ℏ²k/m)^(1/3) ≈ 0.5 * (ℏ²k/m)^(1/3)\nC) (ℏ²k/m)^(1/3) ≈ 1.0 * (ℏ²k/m)^(1/3)\nD) 2(ℏ²k/m)^(1/3) ≈ 2.0 * (ℏ²k/m)^(1/3)\nE) (3/2)(ℏ²k/m)^(1/3) ≈ 1.5 * (ℏ²k/m)^(1/3)\n\nMy result (1.3629 * (ℏ²k/m)^(1/3)) is closest to option E (1.5 * (ℏ²k/m)^(1/3)).\n\nThe correct answer is E) (3/2)(ℏ²k/m)^(1/3).",
