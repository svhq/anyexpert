# E2B Integration Flow Explanation

## How It Works

### The Flow: User → Model → E2B

1. **User asks a question** to our AI model (via unified agent)
2. **The AI model analyzes** the question and decides what tools to use
3. **If code execution is needed**, the model:
   - Writes Python code
   - Calls the E2B manager to execute it
   - Gets results back
   - Incorporates results into its response

### Example Flow

```
User: "Calculate the molecular weight of Ibuprofen"
         ↓
Unified Agent (AI Model): "I need to calculate this"
         ↓
Model writes code: 
```python
# Calculate molecular weight
molecular_formula = {'C': 13, 'H': 18, 'O': 2}
molecular_weight = 13*12.011 + 18*1.008 + 2*15.999
print(f"Molecular Weight: {molecular_weight}")
```
         ↓
E2B Manager executes the code in sandbox
         ↓
Returns: "Molecular Weight: 206.285"
         ↓
Model incorporates result: "The molecular weight of Ibuprofen is 206.285 g/mol"
```

## What We're NOT Doing

❌ We're NOT directly sending queries to E2B
❌ E2B is NOT answering the questions
❌ E2B is NOT an AI - it's just a code execution sandbox

## What We ARE Doing

✅ Our AI model (Gemini/GPT) answers all questions
✅ The model decides when to use E2B for calculations
✅ E2B only executes Python code that the model writes
✅ The model interprets E2B's output and formulates the final answer

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐
│      User       │
└────────┬────────┘
         │ Question

         │   └─→ Executes Python code only
         │       Returns raw output
         │
         └─→ Synthesizes final answer

## Evidence from Our Tests

In all our test queries, you can see:

1. **The model writes the code**:
   ```
   === E2B EXECUTION ===
   Code snippet (first 300 chars):
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import numpy as np
   from scipy.stats import linregress
   ```

2. **E2B just executes and returns output**:
   ```
   Output preview: Linear Regression: Slope = 4.43, Intercept = 62.32
   ```

3. **The model interprets and explains**:
   ```
   Response snippet:
   As Dr. Evelyn Reed, a Data Scientist specializing in educational analytics...
   ```

## Key Point

E2B is just a tool - like a calculator. The AI model is the brain that:
- Understands the question
- Decides what calculations to perform  
- Writes the code
- Interprets the results
- Provides the comprehensive answer

Think of it as: The AI model is the chef, E2B is just the oven.
