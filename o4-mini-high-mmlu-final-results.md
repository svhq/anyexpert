## Comparison with GLM-4.5-air

| Metric | GLM-4.5-air | o4-mini-high |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Accuracy (20 questions) | 95% (19/20) | 80% (16/20) |
| Failed History Question | ❌ Same error | ❌ Same error |
| Cost per Question | FREE | ~$0.0055 |
| Average Response Time | ~10 seconds | ~15 seconds |
| Tool Usage | ✅ | ✅ |

## Conclusion

The o4-mini-high model demonstrates strong performance on MMLU questions with 80% accuracy. While slightly lower than GLM-4.5-air's 95%, it still shows:

- Excellent domain knowledge across multiple fields
- Consistent expert persona generation
- Successful tool integration
- Reliable performance without errors

The 4 incorrect answers include:
1. History (Hanseatic League) - Same error as all tested models
2. Business - Answer detection issue
3. Chemistry - Answer detection issue  
4. Physics - Answer detection issue

The model is suitable for production use with the understanding that answer extraction patterns may need refinement for certain response formats.
