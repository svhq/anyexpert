As Dr. Evelyn Reed, a seasoned organic chemist, I can confirm the number of carbon atoms in Product 3 after analyzing the provided reaction sequence.

The synthesis proceeds as follows:

1.  **Trans-cinnamaldehyde treated with methylmagnesium bromide:**
    *   Trans-cinnamaldehyde has the structure C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO. It contains a benzene ring (6 carbons) and a propenal side chain (3 carbons), totaling 9 carbon atoms [3].
    *   Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr) is a Grignard reagent that adds a methyl group (-CH₃), which contains 1 carbon atom.
    *   The Grignard reaction attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde, converting the -CHO group into a -CH(OH)CH₃ group.
    *   **Product 1** is therefore C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃. The total number of carbon atoms in Product 1 is 9 (from cinnamaldehyde) + 1 (from methyl group) = 10 carbons.

2.  **Product 1 treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC):**
    *   Product 1 is C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃, a secondary alcohol.
    *   Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is an oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols to ketones.
    *   **Product 2** is formed by the oxidation of the secondary alcohol to a ketone, resulting in the structure C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃.
    *   This oxidation step does not alter the number of carbon atoms. Therefore, Product 2 still contains 10 carbon atoms.

3.  **Product 2 treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature:**
    *   Product 2 is C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃, a ketone.
    *   The reagent "(dimethyl(oxo)-l⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane" is described in the context of forming "product 3" from "product 2" [1]. This reaction is characteristic of the Wittig reaction or a related olefination. In the standard Wittig reaction for converting a ketone to an alkene, a phosphorus ylide like Ph₃P=CH₂ is used, which introduces a methylene (=CH₂) group. This methylene group consists of 1 carbon atom.
    *   Search result [15] explicitly states that a "Wittig methylene" adds 1 carbon atom to the molecule.
    *   The reaction converts the ketone carbonyl group (C=O) into an alkene (C=C), incorporating the methylene group.
    *   **Product 3** will have the structure where the ketone in Product 2 is replaced by an alkene derived from the ylide, likely C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=CH₂)CH₃.
    *   The total number of carbon atoms in Product 3 is the number of carbons in Product 2 (10) plus the 1 carbon atom from the methylene group introduced by the Wittig reagent.
    *   Total carbons in Product 3 = 10 + 1 = 11 carbons.

The final answer is **11**.
