As Dr. Emily Carter, Professor of Algebra and Calculus at a leading university, I specialize in function composition, polynomial expressions, and algebraic simplification. I'll build directly on the analysis you provided, verifying each step with rigorous first-principles reasoning to ensure accuracy and clarity. My approach involves breaking down the problem into its core components, performing the necessary substitutions, and simplifying the expressions step by step.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

The query requires evaluating the composite function \( f(g(x, y), g(f(x, y))) \), where:
- \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \)
- \( g(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 \)

This is a classic problem of function composition in multivariable algebra. I'll compute each inner function first, then substitute and simplify.

1. **Compute \( g(x, y) \):**
   \[
   g(x, y) = x^2 - y^2
   \]
   This is a difference of squares, which we'll use later.

2. **Compute \( f(x, y) \):**
   \[
   f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2
   \]
   This is a sum of squares.

3. **Compute \( g(f(x, y)) \):**
   First, substitute \( f(x, y) \) into \( g \). Since \( g \) takes two arguments, and \( f(x, y) \) produces a single value, we treat both inputs to \( g \) as that value:
   \[
   g(f(x, y)) = g(x^2 + y^2, x^2 + y^2)
   \]
   Now apply \( g \):
   \[
   g(x^2 + y^2, x^2 + y^2) = (x^2 + y^2)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)^2
   \]
   Subtracting a term from itself yields:
   \[
   (x^2 + y^2)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)^2 = 0
   \]
   So, \( g(f(x, y)) = 0 \).

4. **Compute \( f(g(x, y), g(f(x, y))) \):**
   Now substitute the results into \( f \):
   \[
   f(g(x, y), g(f(x, y))) = f(x^2 - y^2, 0)
   \]
   Apply \( f \):
   \[
   f(x^2 - y^2, 0) = (x^2 - y^2)^2 + 0^2 = (x^2 - y^2)^2
   \]
   Expand the expression using the binomial theorem:
   \[
   (x^2 - y^2)^2 = (x^2)^2 - 2(x^2)(y^2) + (y^2)^2 = x^4 - 2x^2 y^2 + y^4
   \]
   This confirms the simplified form.

5. **Compare with the Given Options:**
   The final expression, \( x^4 - 2x^2 y^2 + y^4 \), directly matches option H from your list.

This result is algebraically sound and aligns with standard principles of function composition and polynomial expansion. I've double-checked the steps mentally, ensuring no errors in substitution or simplification, as an expert in this field would.

### Final Answer
The value of \( f(g(x, y), g(f(x, y))) \) is \( x^4 - 2x^2 y^2 + y^4 \), which corresponds to option **H**.
