As **Dr. Emily Reyes, Professor of Genomics and Epigenetics at Stanford University**, with over 20 years of experience in molecular biology and high-throughput sequencing, I specialize in unraveling the complex interplay between chromatin architecture, gene regulation, and disease mechanisms, particularly for genes like HOXB2 in the HOX family. Building on my previous analysis, I'll provide a comprehensive yet concise expert answer to your query, drawing directly from the established principles of epigenetics and the web search results you provided.

### Expert Answer

Your investigation into the HOXB2 mutation involves examining how it alters chromatin structure and influences gene expression in patient cells compared to healthy controls. From first principles, effective analysis requires a multi-layered approach: assessing local epigenetic modifications (e.g., histone marks), mapping global 3D chromatin interactions, and quantifying gene expression with validation. This ensures a holistic understanding of how mutations like the one in HOXB2—known for its role in developmental regulation and disease—disrupt these processes.

Based on the options provided, I'll briefly evaluate them using the criteria from my earlier reasoning:

- **Option A (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and qRT-PCR)**: This combination excels at profiling histone modifications (via ChIP-seq) and quantifying transcriptome-wide expression (via RNA-seq), with targeted validation (qRT-PCR). However, it omits 3D chromatin mapping, which is critical for HOX genes that rely on long-range interactions, as evidenced by studies on chromatin structural changes ([1], [3], [7], [12], [13]). Without this, you risk missing key mechanisms like enhancer-promoter looping.

- **Option B (ChIP-seq, chromosome conformation capture, and qRT-PCR)**: This is the most comprehensive option. ChIP-seq identifies local chromatin modifications (e.g., histone marks affected by the mutation), chromosome conformation capture (e.g., Hi-C) reveals 3D structural alterations (such as TADs and loops, as detailed in [1], [3], [7], [13], [27], [34]), and qRT-PCR validates expression changes. This triad aligns perfectly with HOXB2's regulatory context, where epigenetic marks and spatial chromatin dynamics are intertwined (e.g., [2], [12]). It addresses all your investigative needs, allowing for robust comparisons between patient and healthy cells.

- **Option C (ChIP-seq and RNA-seq)**: While useful for linking histone modifications to expression profiles, this lacks 3D analysis and validation, potentially overlooking structural changes central to HOX gene dysregulation ([1], [7], [34]). It's insufficient for a complete picture.

- **Option D (Chromosome conformation capture and RNA-seq)**: This covers 3D structure and expression but neglects detailed epigenetic modifications, such as those involving MLL1 or SETD1a ([2], [12], [33]). Without ChIP-seq, you might miss how the mutation directly alters chromatin accessibility.

After evaluating these against the search results, **Option B** is the optimal choice. It provides a balanced, evidence-based approach to investigate the HOXB2 mutation's impact, integrating techniques commonly used in synergistic studies (e.g., [3], which combines Hi-C with ChIP-seq; [34], linking 3D structure to transcription). This would enable you to:
- Detect mutation-induced epigenetic changes with ChIP-seq.
- Map disrupted chromatin interactions with chromosome conformation capture.
- Confirm expression differences with qRT-PCR for reliable, quantifiable results.

For data analysis, if you proceed with these methods, I recommend using computational tools like a Python sandbox with libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn to integrate and visualize the data, ensuring high accuracy in your comparisons.

**Final Recommendation:** The best combination of methods for your investigations is **Option B: ChIP-seq, chromosome conformation capture, and qRT-PCR**. This will yield the most insightful and actionable results for understanding the HOXB2 mutation's role in your genetic disease.
