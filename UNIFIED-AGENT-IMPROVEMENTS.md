# Unified Agent Improvements Summary

## Date: 2025-08-03

### Problem Identified
- Rigid sequential pattern (search → reason → synthesize) prevented strategic tool use
- Only 8.3% of responses used E2B code execution despite having capable libraries
- No parallel execution of tools
- Keyword-based decisions instead of intelligent planning

### Improvements Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced System Prompt
- Added accurate list of all available Python libraries in E2B
- Emphasized strategic tool usage: "search for current/external info, code for calculations/verification"
- Added note about parallel tool usage capability

#### 2. JSON-Based Planning
- Replaced keyword heuristics with structured JSON planning
- Low temperature (0.1) for deterministic planning
- Returns: `{next_action, need_search, need_code, can_parallelize, rationale}`
- Fallback logic for GLM-4.5 JSON parsing issues

#### 3. Parallel Execution
- Added capability to run search + code in parallel on first step
- Detects when both tools are needed and executes concurrently
- Combines results for comprehensive analysis

#### 4. Native Tool Support
- Added tool definitions for OpenRouter API
- Support for tool_choice parameter
- Prepared for future native tool calling

#### 5. Updated Library List
- Corrected E2B library list to include:
  - Core: math, numpy, scipy, sympy, mpmath
  - Data: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
  - Bio: biopython, splicekit, deeptools
  - Utils: beautifulsoup4, requests

### Test Results
- Successfully tested with GPQA Q6 (Contact Angle)
- Model used code execution 6 times (vs 0 previously)
- Got correct answer: B) 124°
- Demonstrated strategic tool selection based on problem type

### Expected Benefits
1. **Higher Accuracy**: Code verification catches calculation errors
2. **Faster Response**: Parallel execution when beneficial
3. **Better Tool Usage**: From 8.3% → ~40% E2B usage for applicable questions
4. **Smarter Planning**: JSON-based decisions instead of keywords

### Recommendations
- Switch to Gemini-2.5-flash-lite for production (GLM-4.5 has JSON issues)
- Monitor tool usage statistics
- Consider adding more parallel execution scenarios beyond round-0
- Test with remaining GPQA wrong answers to verify improvements
