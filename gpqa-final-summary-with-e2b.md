# GPQA Test Results - GLM-4.5-air (Final Summary)

## Overall Performance
- **Total Questions**: 5
- **Correct**: 1/5 (20%)
- **Model**: GLM-4.5-air:free

## Detailed Results

### Question 1: Molecular Biology - Gene Therapy (Dystrophin/Exon Skipping)
- **Model Answer**: B (polyA tail)
- **Correct Answer**: D (R-loops)
- **Result**: ❌ Incorrect
- **Analysis**: Model correctly understood the therapy mechanism but chose polyA tail (post-splicing) over R-loops (transcription-related)

### Question 2: Physics - Quantum State Energy Resolution
- **Model Answer**: Could not complete
- **Correct Answer**: D (10^-4 eV)
- **Result**: ❌ Error
- **Issue**: Math agent timeout with E2B service (JSON parsing error after long computation)

### Question 3: Organic Chemistry - Synthesis Carbon Count
- **Model Answer**: Could not complete
- **Correct Answer**: A (11 carbon atoms)
- **Result**: ❌ Error
- **Issue**: Code agent timeout with E2B service (JSON parsing error)

### Question 4: Molecular Biology - Chromatin Analysis Methods
- **Model Answer**: D (Chromosome conformation capture and RNA-seq)
- **Correct Answer**: B (ChIP-seq, chromosome conformation capture, and qRT-PCR)
- **Result**: ❌ Incorrect
- **Note**: Model actually recommended B in its explanation but extraction failed!

### Question 5: Quantum Mechanics - Spin State Expectation Value
- **Model Answer**: A (-0.7)
- **Correct Answer**: A (-0.7)
- **Result**: ✅ Correct
- **Analysis**: Perfect quantum mechanics calculation without needing E2B

## Key Findings

1. **Question Reception**: All questions and options were received correctly - verified by comparing sent prompts with source data

2. **E2B Service Issues**: 
   - E2B service is running and functional (tested with simple Python code)
   - Complex questions trigger very long computations that timeout
   - The math/code agents may be generating overly complex solutions

3. **Answer Extraction**: Question 4 shows the model gave the correct answer in its explanation but our extraction patterns missed it

4. **GPQA Difficulty**: These questions are significantly harder than MMLU (20% vs 92% accuracy), requiring deep domain expertise

## Recommendations
- For GPQA testing, consider disabling code execution for pure knowledge evaluation
- Improve answer extraction patterns to catch recommendations in explanatory text
- Set shorter timeouts for code execution to prevent JSON parsing errors
