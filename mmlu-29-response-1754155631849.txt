As **Professor Eleanor Vance, a specialist in Medieval English History**, I can definitively state that the Magna Carta, signed in 1215, is significant because it:

**(D) limited the power of the king and established certain legal rights.**

My expertise in medieval English history confirms that the Magna Carta was a foundational document in the development of constitutional law. Forced upon King John by his barons, it was a direct response to his abuses of power and established the crucial principle that the monarch was not above the law. It sought to regulate royal authority and protect the rights of subjects.

To elaborate on why option (D) is the most accurate and why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Limited the power of the king and established certain legal rights:** This is the core significance. The Magna Carta introduced concepts such as due process, protection against unlawful imprisonment (a precursor to *habeas corpus*), and limitations on royal taxation without consent. These provisions were revolutionary for their time, asserting that even the king must adhere to legal procedures and respect the rights of his subjects [1].

Now, let's address the other options and explain why they are inaccurate:

*   **(A) established the divine right of kings:** This is the opposite of the Magna Carta's effect. It challenged absolute monarchical power by asserting the rule of law over the king.
*   **(B) created the first parliament:** The development of Parliament was a much longer, evolutionary process that began to take shape over centuries. The Magna Carta did not create Parliament but rather laid some groundwork for later representative institutions.
*   **(C) abolished the monarchy:** The charter aimed to reform the monarchy and limit its power, not to abolish it entirely.
*   **(E) granted universal suffrage:** Universal suffrage is a modern democratic concept and was not a part of the Magna Carta's provisions, which primarily concerned the rights of barons and freemen.
*   **(F) established religious freedom:** While the Magna Carta did contain clauses concerning the freedom of the English Church, it did not establish broad religious freedom as understood today, which encompasses freedom of worship for all faiths.
*   **(G) created the first democracy:** The Magna Carta was a step towards constitutionalism and limited government, not a democratic system with widespread popular participation.
*   **(H) unified England and Scotland:** The union of England and Scotland did not occur until the Acts of Union in 1707.
*   **(I) ended the Hundred Years' War:** The Hundred Years' War took place between 1337 and 1453, long after the Magna Carta was signed.
*   **(J) established the Church of England:** The formal establishment of the Church of England occurred centuries later, notably during the English Reformation in the 16th century.

In conclusion, the Magna Carta's enduring legacy lies in its groundbreaking assertion of the rule of law and its establishment of fundamental legal protections, thereby limiting the arbitrary power of the monarch.
