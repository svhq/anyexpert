      "full_response": "I am Dr. Elena Morgan, Professor of Mathematics specializing in Polynomial Equations.\n\nFor the cubic function \\( f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1 \\), the number of real roots depends on the nature of its discriminant and critical points. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **General fact about cubic polynomials:** Any cubic polynomial with real coefficients has at least one real root because the function is continuous and goes from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\) as \\(x\\) moves from negative to positive infinity[1].\n\n2. **Determining the number of real roots:** Cubics can have either one or three real roots. This depends on the discriminant or equivalently on the shape of the graph (whether it crosses the x-axis once or three times)[3][5].\n\n3. **Critical points of \\( f(x) \\):** Find the derivative:\n   \\[   f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3 = 3(x^2 - 1) = 0 \\implies x = \\pm 1.\n   \\]\n   These are the local extrema.\n\n4. **Evaluate \\(f(x)\\) at critical points:**\n   \\[   f(-1) = (-1)^3 - 3(-1) + 1 = -1 + 3 + 1 = 3 > 0,\n   \\]\n   \\[   f(1) = 1^3 - 3(1) + 1 = 1 - 3 + 1 = -1 < 0.\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\(f(-1) > 0\\) and \\(f(1) < 0\\), the function crosses the x-axis between these points, and there are two different signs at the extrema, indicating the curve goes above and below the x-axis, so it must cross three times.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** The function \\(f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1\\) has **three distinct real roots**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D) 3**[3][4].\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** Because the cubic has two critical points with values on opposite sides of zero, it crosses the x-axis three times, implying three real roots."

      "full_response": "The correct answer is **B) It adds repetitive nucleotide sequences to chromosome ends**.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nTelomerase is an enzyme whose primary function is to maintain the length of telomeres, which are repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes. During DNA replication, telomeres naturally shorten, but telomerase counteracts this shortening by adding specific repetitive sequences (in humans, the sequence TTAGGG) to the chromosome ends. This action helps protect chromosomes from damage and prevents loss of important genetic information during cell division[1][2][3][4].\n\n- Option A (removes damaged DNA segments) describes DNA repair enzymes, not telomerase.\n- Option C (unwinds the DNA double helix) is the function of helicase enzymes.\n- Option D (synthesizes RNA primers) is the role of primase.\n\nTherefore, telomeraseâ€™s unique role is to **add repetitive nucleotide sequences to chromosome ends**, maintaining telomere length and chromosome stability[1][2][3][4]."

      "full_response": "The correct answer is **C) Spontaneous recovery**.\n\n**Explanation:** In classical conditioning, **spontaneous recovery** refers to the phenomenon where a conditioned response that had disappeared after extinction suddenly reappears after a rest period without further conditioning. Extinction is the process where the conditioned response diminishes because the conditioned stimulus is repeatedly presented without the unconditioned stimulus. However, after some time passes, the conditioned response can re-emerge unexpectedly and temporarily, demonstrating that the original learning was not completely erased but rather suppressed or dormant[1][2][3][4].\n\nThe other options do not describe this phenomenon:\n- **Generalization** refers to responding similarly to stimuli that resemble the conditioned stimulus.\n- **Discrimination** is learning to respond only to the specific conditioned stimulus and not to others.\n- **Higher-order conditioning** involves pairing a new stimulus with a previously conditioned stimulus to elicit the conditioned response.\n\nTherefore, spontaneous recovery is the specific term for the reappearance of a conditioned response after extinction has occurred."

      "full_response": "I am Dr. Michael Reynolds, Database Systems Specialist.\n\nThe correct answer is **B) It is in 2NF and has no transitive dependencies**.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- Third Normal Form (3NF) requires the relation to first meet all the requirements of Second Normal Form (2NF), meaning it must have no partial dependency on a candidate key.\n- Additionally, 3NF eliminates **transitive dependencies**, where a non-prime attribute depends on another non-prime attribute rather than directly on the primary key.\n- This means every non-key attribute must depend only on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.\n- For example, if attribute A determines B, and B determines C, then C is transitively dependent on A through B. To be in 3NF, such transitive dependencies must be removed, typically by creating separate relations.\n\nOther options explained:\n\n- **A) It has a primary key**: While having a primary key is necessary for any relation, it alone does not guarantee 3NF.\n- **C) All attributes are atomic**: This is a requirement of First Normal Form (1NF), not specifically 3NF.\n- **D) It has no null values**: Null values are not directly related to 3NF requirements.\n\nThus, 3NF is defined as a relation that is in 2NF and has no transitive dependencies among its attributes[1][2][4]."

      "full_response": "The correct answer is **C) Private parties can solve externality problems through bargaining**.\n\nThe Coase theorem states that when property rights are well-defined and transaction costs are zero, private parties will bargain with each other to reach an efficient allocation of resources, resolving externality problems without the need for government intervention. This outcome is efficient and invariant to the initial assignment of property rights, meaning the parties will negotiate until the resource is used by whoever values it most[1][2][3].\n\nExplanation:\n\n- **Well-defined property rights** mean that the ownership and usage rights are clear and enforceable.\n- **Zero transaction costs** imply no costs or barriers to bargaining, such as legal fees, information costs, or negotiation difficulties.\n- Under these conditions, parties affected by externalities can negotiate compensation or agreements that internalize the external costs or benefits.\n- This leads to an efficient outcome where resources are allocated optimally, regardless of who holds the initial rights.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n- A) Government intervention is *not* always necessary if private bargaining can resolve the externality efficiently.\n- B) Market failure is *not* inevitable under zero transaction costs and well-defined property rights; the market can self-correct.\n- D) The Coase theorem does not specifically address public goods or their production levels; it focuses on externalities and property rights.\n\nThus, option C accurately captures the essence of the Coase theorem."
