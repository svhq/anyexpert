As **Dr. Evelyn Reed, Plant Physiologist**, I can definitively state that the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis are intrinsically linked to the Calvin cycle by providing it with the essential chemical energy and reducing power it needs to function. My analysis of the provided research confirms this.

Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, is typically divided into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (commonly known as the Calvin cycle).

1.  **Light-Dependent Reactions:** These reactions occur within the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. Their primary function is to capture light energy and convert it into chemical energy. This conversion involves:
    *   The photolysis (splitting) of water molecules, which releases electrons, protons (H+), and oxygen as a byproduct.
    *   The energized electrons being passed along an electron transport chain, driving the synthesis of **ATP (adenosine triphosphate)**.
    *   The electrons and protons ultimately reducing NADP+ to **NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form)**.
    Therefore, the net products of the light-dependent reactions that are critical for the next stage are ATP and NADPH.

2.  **Calvin Cycle (Light-Independent Reactions):** These reactions take place in the stroma of the chloroplasts. They do not directly require light but depend on the products of the light-dependent reactions. The Calvin cycle's main purpose is carbon fixationâ€”converting atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic sugar molecules. This process requires energy input and reducing power, which are supplied by:
    *   **ATP:** Provides the chemical energy needed to drive the endergonic reactions of carbon fixation and sugar formation.
    *   **NADPH:** Provides the reducing power (electrons and protons) necessary to reduce the intermediate carbon compounds, ultimately leading to the formation of carbohydrates.

Now, let's evaluate the provided options based on this understanding:

*   **(A) CO2 released by the light-dependent reactions provides the raw material for the Calvin cycle.** This is incorrect. CO2 is an *input* to the Calvin cycle, taken from the atmosphere, not a product released by the light-dependent reactions.
*   **(B) The light reactions provide oxygen for the light-independent reactions.** This is incorrect. Oxygen is a *byproduct* of the light-dependent reactions (from water splitting) and is released into the atmosphere; it is not utilized by the Calvin cycle.
*   **(C) Water entering the plant through the roots provides hydrogen directly to the Calvin cycle.** This is incorrect. Water is split in the light-dependent reactions. The hydrogen ions (protons) and electrons are used to form NADPH, and it is NADPH that delivers the hydrogen to the Calvin cycle.
*   **(D) ATP and NADPH provide the power and raw materials for the Calvin cycle.** **This is the correct statement.** ATP supplies the energy, and NADPH supplies the reducing power (hydrogen and electrons), both of which are essential for the Calvin cycle to convert CO2 into sugars.
*   **(E) The light reactions provide nitrogen to the Calvin cycle for protein synthesis.** This is incorrect. Nitrogen is a crucial nutrient for plants, but it is absorbed from the soil and used for synthesizing amino acids and proteins, not directly involved in the Calvin cycle's carbon fixation process, nor is it supplied by the light reactions.
*   **(F) Glucose and fructose are supplied to the Calvin cycle by the light reactions.** This is incorrect. Glucose and fructose are *products* of the Calvin cycle, synthesized using the energy and reducing power from the light reactions.
*   **(G) The light reactions supply the Calvin cycle with sunlight directly.** This is incorrect. Sunlight is the initial energy source, but the light reactions convert it into chemical energy (ATP and NADPH) before it can be used by the Calvin cycle.
*   **(H) ATP and NADPH are broken down in the light reactions to supply the Calvin cycle with energy.** This is incorrect. ATP and NADPH are *produced* in the light reactions and *consumed* (their energy and reducing power are utilized) in the Calvin cycle.
*   **(I) The light reactions provide carbon dioxide for the light-independent reactions.** This is incorrect. CO2 is an external input from the atmosphere for the Calvin cycle.
*   **(J) The light reactions supply the Calvin cycle with water and oxygen.** This is incorrect. Water is split in the light reactions, and oxygen is released; neither is supplied to the Calvin cycle.

In summary, the light-dependent reactions are vital for generating the energy currency (ATP) and the reducing power (NADPH) that fuel the synthesis of carbohydrates in the Calvin cycle.

The final answer is **(D)**.
