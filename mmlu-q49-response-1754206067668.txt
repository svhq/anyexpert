As **Dr. Evelyn Reed, Senior Economist specializing in National Accounts**, I have reviewed the provided analysis and the GDP expenditure components. My expertise lies in accurately categorizing economic transactions to measure national output.

Based on the standard breakdown of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) into its expenditure components:

**GDP = C (Consumption) + I (Investment) + G (Government Spending) + (X - M) (Net Exports)**

Let's meticulously re-evaluate each option against the definition of Consumption (C), which primarily includes household spending on final goods and services.

*   **(A) The purchase of a new car by a car rental company:** This is a purchase of a capital good used to produce a service. It is classified as **Investment (I)** because it represents business spending on capital assets.

*   **(B) The purchase of a new construction crane by a construction company:** Similar to (A), this is a capital good purchased by a business for production purposes. It falls under **Investment (I)**.

*   **(C) A company buying a new office building:** This transaction represents business spending on a capital asset (non-residential investment). It is classified as **Investment (I)**.

*   **(D) A homeowner mowing her own lawn:** This activity is considered non-market production; it is household production for self-consumption and is **excluded** from GDP calculations.

*   **(E) Flour purchased by a baker to make donuts:** Flour is an **intermediate good**. Its value is fully incorporated into the final product (donuts). GDP measures the value of **final goods and services**, so intermediate goods are not directly counted to avoid double-counting. The sale of the donuts would be counted as consumption.

*   **(F) The purchase of new computer software by an accounting firm:** This is an acquisition of a capital good (intangible asset) by a business for its operations. It is classified as **Investment (I)**.

*   **(G) $50.00 spent eating out at a restaurant:** This transaction reflects household spending on a final service (the meal and associated service). This is a direct component of **Consumption (C)**.

*   **(H) A barber cutting his own hair:** Like option (D), this is a non-market activity (self-service) and is **excluded** from GDP.

My analysis confirms that only option (G) represents household spending on a final good or service. Therefore, it is the sole item among the choices that would be classified under **C (Consumption)** in GDP calculations.

**Final Answer:**

Based on the expenditure approach to calculating GDP, the purchase of $50.00 spent eating out at a restaurant is classified under **C (Consumption)**.
