# Final Analysis of Wrong Answers

## Data Quality Issue Found

The psychology ethics question (Q6) has **corrupted data** from Excel extraction:
- Multiple options are empty or truncated
- The "correct answer" is listed as "I" but options only go up to "H"
- This makes it impossible to properly evaluate the answers

## Verified Results

### o4-mini-high (1 wrong answer)

**Question 6 (Psychology Ethics)**: ⚠️ **INVALID DUE TO DATA CORRUPTION**
- Selected: H) "provide Hermann with appropriate referrals"
- Listed correct: I) [doesn't exist]
- **Verdict**: Cannot determine - data error

### GLM-4.5-air (5 wrong answers)

**Question 3 (Law - Robbery)**: ❌ **TRULY WRONG**
- Selected: A) Larceny
- Correct: D) Robbery, because he used force to take possession
- The model incorrectly classified it as larceny when force was used during taking

**Question 5 (Psychology - Rancho Scale)**: ⚠️ **EXTRACTION FAILURE**
- Selected: NULL (no answer extracted)
- Correct: E) Confused and incoherent, may exhibit bizarre behavior
- The model likely gave the right answer but extraction failed

**Question 6 (Psychology Ethics)**: ⚠️ **INVALID DUE TO DATA CORRUPTION**
- Selected: A) [truncated option]
- Listed correct: I) [doesn't exist]

**Question 8 (Biology - Photosynthesis)**: ❌ **TRULY WRONG**
- Selected: J) Water and oxygen
- Correct: D) ATP and NADPH
- Factual error about photosynthesis light reaction products

**Question 9 (Chemistry - Bonding)**: ❌ **TRULY WRONG**
- Selected: J) Polar covalent bonding
- Correct: C) Covalent network bonding
- Misidentified bonding type for high-melting, non-conducting solid

## Revised Accuracy

### Excluding Invalid Questions:
- **o4-mini-high**: 9/9 valid questions correct = **100%**
- **GLM-4.5-air**: 5/9 valid questions correct = **56%**

### Confirmed True Errors:
- **o4-mini-high**: 0 true errors (1 was data corruption)
- **GLM-4.5-air**: 3 true errors + 1 extraction failure

## Conclusion

The o4-mini-high model actually achieved **perfect accuracy** on all valid questions. The GLM-4.5-air model had 3 genuine knowledge errors and 1 answer extraction failure. The data quality issues from Excel parsing affected the evaluation of both models on the psychology ethics question.
