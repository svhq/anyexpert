The core challenge with local caching of files in distributed file systems, as overwhelmingly supported by the provided research, is maintaining **cache consistency**. This refers to the problem of ensuring that all cached copies of a file, distributed across various client machines, accurately reflect the most recent version of that file.

The research indicates that when data is cached locally, and the original file on the server is modified, the cached copies on client machines can become outdated or "stale" [1, 2, 4, 6, 11, 12, 16, 21, 22, 24, 25, 35, 38]. This phenomenon directly leads to a situation where different machines can have divergent views of the same file.

Let's evaluate the given options against this understanding:

*   **(A) Temporary inconsistencies among views of a file by different machines can result:** This option precisely describes the cache consistency problem. If a file is updated on the server, and client caches have not yet been synchronized or invalidated, different clients will indeed see different versions of the file. This is a direct and frequently cited drawback of local caching.

*   **(B) The file system is likely to be corrupted when a computer crashes:** While client crashes can lead to data loss if data is only in transit or in a write-back cache that hasn't been committed [3], this is a matter of fault tolerance and reliability rather than an inherent disadvantage of the caching mechanism itself. File system corruption is a broader issue not solely attributable to caching.

*   **(C) A much higher amount of network traffic results:** This is contrary to the primary benefit of caching, which is to *reduce* network traffic by serving data from local caches [8, 23, 32]. While cache invalidation protocols can add some overhead, it's not the main disadvantage.

*   **(D) Caching makes file access slower:** The purpose of caching is to improve performance and speed up file access by leveraging faster local storage [15, 19, 32]. While poorly implemented caching or specific access patterns might lead to performance degradation [5, 10], the fundamental goal is acceleration.

*   **(E) Files can only be accessed sequentially:** There is no evidence in the provided research to suggest that caching restricts file access to sequential operations.

*   **(F) Caching requires too much memory:** Caching does consume memory, but the research does not universally identify this as the primary disadvantage. Device storage limitations are mentioned as a constraint [14], but not necessarily that the memory requirement is inherently "too much."

*   **(G) Cache misses are impossible to handle:** Cache misses are a standard operational aspect of caching and are handled by retrieving the requested data from the origin. This is not a disadvantage of caching.

*   **(H) Files cannot be shared between users:** Distributed file systems are fundamentally designed for file sharing. Caching does not inherently prevent sharing, although consistency issues can complicate shared access.

*   **(I) Caching prevents concurrent access:** Caching itself does not prevent concurrent access. The challenge lies in managing concurrent access and ensuring consistency across cached copies, which is related to option (A).

*   **(J) The server becomes overloaded:** Caching typically offloads read requests from the server, thereby reducing server load [23, 27, 32]. While certain complex consistency mechanisms might introduce server overhead, it is not the primary identified disadvantage.

In summary, the most significant and consistently reported disadvantage of local file caching in distributed file systems is the inherent difficulty in maintaining data consistency, which can lead to temporary inconsistencies in how different machines view a file.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

**(A) Temporary inconsistencies among views of a file by different machines can result**
