As **Dr. Evelyn Reed, Corporate Governance Analyst**, I have thoroughly reviewed the provided research and analysis to determine the correct completion of the statement regarding managerial duties.

The statement reads: "Managers are entrusted to run the company in the best interest of ________. Specifically, they have a duty to act for the benefit of the company, as well as a duty of ________ and of _______."

Based on the extensive research, the following points are critical:

1.  **Primary Beneficiary:** The overwhelming consensus in the provided search results is that managers (and directors) owe their fiduciary duties primarily to the **Shareholders**. While some sources mention considering the interests of employees [3] or stakeholders [1], the core fiduciary responsibility is consistently directed towards shareholders. For instance, results [2], [9], [12], [13], [15], [32] explicitly state that directors fulfill their fiduciary duty *to shareholders*. Result [33] and [40] also clarify that shareholders own the corporation, while managers/officers run it, indicating a principal-agent relationship where agents (managers) act for the principals (shareholders).

2.  **Core Fiduciary Duties:** The fundamental fiduciary duties of corporate managers and directors are consistently identified as the **Duty of Care** and the **Duty of Loyalty** [2, 4, 10, 11, 12, 15, 20, 32, 35]. Some sources also mention a **Duty of Obedience** [4, 8, 20], but Care and Loyalty are the most frequently cited and central duties.

3.  **Components of Duties:**
    *   The **Duty of Care** is described as requiring directors and officers to act with reasonable **diligence**, **care**, and **skill** [8, 14, 17]. It mandates informed decision-making and staying abreast of corporate developments [31].
    *   The **Duty of Loyalty** requires acting in the corporation's and shareholders' best interests, avoiding conflicts of interest, and prioritizing the company's well-being over personal interests [2, 8, 9, 18, 38].

Now, let's evaluate the given options against these established principles:

*   **(A) Shareholders, Diligence, Self-interest:** "Shareholders" is correct. "Diligence" is a component of the Duty of Care. "Self-interest" is what the Duty of Loyalty aims to prevent, not a duty itself.
*   **(B) Shareholders, Self-interest, Care and Skill:** "Shareholders" is correct. "Self-interest" is incorrect as a duty.
*   **(C) Stakeholders, Care and skill, Self-interest:** "Stakeholders" is less precise than "Shareholders" as the primary beneficiary. "Self-interest" is incorrect.
*   **(D) Stakeholders, Diligence, Care and Skill:** "Stakeholders" is less precise. "Diligence" and "Care and Skill" are components of the Duty of Care.
*   **(E) Customers, Care and Skill, Diligence:** "Customers" is incorrect as the primary beneficiary.
*   **(F) Shareholders, Care and Skill, Diligence:** "Shareholders" is correct. "Care and Skill" and "Diligence" are both key components describing the **Duty of Care**. While the Duty of Loyalty is a core duty, it is not presented as one of the two specific duties in the blanks for this option. However, the question asks for *a* duty of X and *a* duty of Y, and these are accurate descriptions of aspects of the Duty of Care.
*   **(G) Shareholders, Self-interest, Diligence:** "Shareholders" is correct. "Self-interest" is incorrect as a duty.
*   **(H) Employees, Care and Skill, Diligence:** "Employees" is incorrect as the primary beneficiary.
*   **(I) Stakeholder, Self-interest, Diligence:** "Stakeholder" is singular and less precise. "Self-interest" is incorrect.
*   **(J) Stakeholder, Care and Skill, Diligence:** "Stakeholder" is singular and less precise. "Care and Skill" and "Diligence" are components of the Duty of Care.

Considering the structure of the question, which asks for the beneficiary and then two specific duties (or components of duties), option (F) aligns best with the evidence. "Shareholders" is the correct beneficiary. "Care and Skill" and "Diligence" are accurate descriptions of the **Duty of Care**, which is a primary fiduciary duty. While the Duty of Loyalty is also a primary duty, it is not offered in conjunction with "Shareholders" and these specific components of the Duty of Care across the options. Therefore, option (F) provides the most accurate and comprehensive answer based on the provided research.

The completed statement is: "Managers are entrusted to run the company in the best interest of **Shareholders**. Specifically, they have a duty to act for the benefit of the company, as well as a duty of **Care and Skill** and of **Diligence**."

The final answer is **(F)**.
