As Dr. Evelyn Reed, a leading Evolutionary Geneticist, I can definitively answer your question:

The option that is **NOT** a source of genetic variation during sexual reproduction is **(B) Binary fission**.

Here's a comprehensive breakdown of why, addressing each option in the context of sexual reproduction:

*   **(A) Random fertilization:** This is a critical source of genetic variation in sexual reproduction. Each gamete (sperm or egg) is genetically unique due to meiosis. The chance combination of any sperm with any egg creates a vast number of possible zygote genotypes, thus generating significant variation in offspring [1].

*   **(B) Binary fission:** This is a method of asexual reproduction, primarily used by prokaryotes and some single-celled eukaryotes. In binary fission, a single cell divides into two genetically identical daughter cells. Since it does not involve the exchange or recombination of genetic material, and its products are clones, it is **not** a source of genetic variation during sexual reproduction [2].

*   **(C) Crossing over during meiosis:** This process, also known as recombination, occurs during Prophase I of meiosis. Homologous chromosomes exchange segments of DNA, creating new combinations of alleles on the same chromosome. This directly generates novel genetic combinations in the gametes [1].

*   **(D) Independent assortment of chromosomes:** During Metaphase I of meiosis, homologous chromosome pairs align randomly at the metaphase plate. The orientation of each pair is independent of the others, leading to different combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes in the resulting gametes. This is a major contributor to genetic diversity in sexually reproducing organisms [1].

*   **(E) Mutation:** Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence and are the ultimate source of all new genetic variation (new alleles). While mutations can occur at any time, they provide the raw material that is then shuffled and redistributed by the mechanisms of sexual reproduction [3].

*   **(F) Random mating:** While random mating does not create new alleles, it ensures that the existing variations are combined randomly within a population. This process contributes to the distribution of genetic variation among offspring by allowing all possible combinations of gametes to be equally likely, thereby maintaining heterozygosity and genetic diversity [4].

*   **(G) Gene flow:** Gene flow, or migration, is the movement of alleles between populations. When individuals migrate and reproduce in a new population, they introduce new alleles or alter the frequencies of existing alleles, thereby increasing genetic variation within the receiving population [3].

*   **(H) Genetic drift:** This refers to random fluctuations in allele frequencies from one generation to the next, particularly potent in small populations. While it doesn't create new alleles, it can lead to the loss of some alleles and the fixation of others, thus changing the genetic makeup of a population and contributing to variation *between* populations over time [3].

*   **(I) Natural selection:** Natural selection is a process where individuals with traits that confer a survival or reproductive advantage in a given environment are more likely to reproduce and pass on their alleles. It acts on existing genetic variation, favoring certain alleles and increasing their frequency in the population, thereby shaping the distribution of variation [3].

*   **(J) Sexual selection:** This is a form of natural selection that acts on an organism's ability to obtain a mate. It can lead to the evolution of traits that increase mating success, even if they are detrimental to survival. Like natural selection, it acts on existing variation and influences the frequency of alleles related to mating success [3].

Therefore, binary fission, being a mechanism of asexual reproduction, is the only process listed that does not contribute to genetic variation *during sexual reproduction*.
