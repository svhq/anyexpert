    question: "A woman was standing in the aisle of a subway car and put her purse on the seat next to her. A man approached the woman from behind and grabbed the purse off the seat. He then pushed the woman out of the way and ran out of the subway car while carrying the purse. The man was apprehended on the subway platform while in possession of the purse. In a jurisdiction that follows the common law with respect to criminal offenses, of what crime can the man properly be convicted?",
    options: [
      "A) Larceny, because he took the purse without the woman's consent.",
      "B) Burglary, because he entered the subway car with the intention of committing a theft.",
      "C) Robbery, because he used force in leaving with the purse.",
      "D) Robbery, because he used force to take possession of the purse.",
      "E) Theft from a person's vicinity.",
      "F) Assault and larceny.",

    question: "A federal grand jury was investigating a corporation whose tanker ship had spilled crude oil into environmentally sensitive waters. The grand jury issued a subpoena requiring the corporation to produce all emails and internal documents regarding the corporation's knowledge of the risks of an oil spill. The corporation has objected, citing its Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Can the subpoena be enforced?",
    options: [
      "A) Yes, because the Fifth Amendment privilege only applies to personal testimonies.",
      "B) Yes, because a corporation has no Fifth Amendment privilege.",
      "C) No, because the corporation was not granted use-and-derivative-use immunity.",
      "D) No, because the corporation was not granted transactional immunity.",
      "E) Yes, because the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to the compelled production of documents.",
      "F) No, because the documents are protected under attorney-client privilege.",
      "G) No, because a corporation has the same Fifth Amendment rights as an individual.",

During the first session with Hermann, you find out that his political views are completely repugnant to you, and you feel that you would not enjoy working with him. As an ethical psychologist, you should:",
