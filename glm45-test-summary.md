# GLM-4.5 Test Summary and Issues Found

## Key Findings

### 1. **Answer Extraction Issue**
The GLM-4.5 model is using a different response format than expected:
- Uses bold markdown: `**C) Concrete operational stage**`
- Our extraction patterns were looking for simpler formats
- This caused many correct answers to be marked as wrong

### 2. **Actual Performance (Based on Manual Verification)**
When we manually checked the responses:
- Psychology (Piaget): Model correctly said "**C) Concrete operational stage**" ✅
- CS (Merge Sort): Model correctly said "**B) O(n log n)**" ✅

These were marked wrong due to extraction failure, not incorrect answers.

### 3. **Pattern of "J" Selections**
Many questions showed "J" as selected, which appears to be:
- A fallback when extraction fails
- The last option being picked by the simple regex

### 4. **Response Quality**
The GLM-4.5 responses are:
- Well-structured with expert personas
- Detailed explanations
- Correct identification of answers
- Using markdown formatting extensively

## Estimated True Performance

Based on the extraction issue, the true performance is likely much higher:
- **Reported**: ~17% (5/29 in progress)
- **Estimated Actual**: 70-80% (similar to GLM-4.5-air)

## Recommendations

1. **Fix extraction patterns** to handle markdown formats
2. **Re-run the complete test** with fixed extraction
3. **Consider the model's formatting** in production use

The GLM-4.5 model appears to be performing well, but our test harness wasn't adapted to its response format.
