# SAVEPOINT: Before Unified Agent Refactoring
**Date**: August 1, 2025
**Time**: 11:52 PM

## Current State Summary

### GPQA Performance
- **Current Score**: 7/10 (70%) after reducing verbosity
- **Original Score**: 5/10 (50%)
- **Improvements**: Fixed Q3 (chemistry) and Q7 (genetics)
- **Still failing**: Q4 (molecular biology), Q8 (electromagnetism), Q9 (chemistry timeout)

### Recent Changes Made
1. Removed verbose instructions from math agent
2. Kept only essential Python library listings
3. Achieved 45-55% response length reduction

### Current Architecture
```
User Query → Query Analyzer → Route to Agent → Response
                ↓
         ├─ Math Agent (Python execution)
         ├─ Code Agent (Code execution)
         ├─ Information Synthesizer (Web search)
         └─ Direct Answer (No tools)
```

### Key Files in Current State

#### 1. System Prompt (`src/system-prompt.js`)
- Base prompt with expert personas
- Instructions for step-by-step reasoning
- ~25 lines of instructions

#### 2. Math Agent (`src/math-agent.js`)
- Modified to reduce verbosity
- Line 46: `content: SYSTEM_PROMPT` (simple math)
- Line 79-88: Minimal library list for complex math
- No longer has "explain step-by-step" instructions

#### 3. Query Analyzer (`src/query-analyzer.js`)
- Routes queries to different agents
- Often misclassifies (many go to "unknown")
- Complex routing logic

#### 4. Workflow Engine (`src/workflow-engine.js`)
- Orchestrates the multi-agent system
- Handles routing based on query analysis

### Problems with Current Architecture
1. **Fragmented tool access**: Each agent only has specific tools
2. **Routing errors**: Query analyzer often misclassifies
3. **Redundant prompts**: Each agent repeats base prompt
4. **Artificial boundaries**: Can't combine tools easily

### Proposed Changes
- Single unified agent with ALL tools available
- Remove routing logic
- Clearer, more concise system prompt
- Let model decide which tools to use

### How to Restore This State
If unified agent approach doesn't work:
1. This savepoint documents exact state
2. Git history has all code changes
3. Key insight: Reducing verbosity helped significantly

### Test Results to Preserve
- Q3: Now correct with 10,081 chars (was 18,496)
- Q7: Now correct with proper double crossover understanding
- Q8: Still wrong but response clearer
- Q9: Still times out on chemistry
- Q4: Still prefers modern methods

### Critical Settings
- `max_tokens: 1000000` in math-agent.js
- `E2B_TEMPLATE_ID=prod-all` in .env
- API server at localhost:3000
- E2B service for Python execution

**Note**: This savepoint created before major architectural change to unified agent approach. If issues arise, refer back to this state where we achieved 70% GPQA accuracy.
