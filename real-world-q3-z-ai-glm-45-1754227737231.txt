Thank you for your question about retirement planning. Let me analyze your situation based on the findings and provide a strategic approach for your goal to retire by 55.

## Analysis of Your Situation

At 28 with $50,000 saved and a retirement goal of 55, you have a 27-year accumulation period, which is quite solid for early retirement. The findings suggest several key considerations:

### 1. Account Type Prioritization

Based on the search results, here's how I recommend prioritizing your investment vehicles:

**First priority: Max out your 401(k) up to the employer match**
- This is essentially free money that you shouldn't leave on the table
- Results #10 and #11 suggest prioritizing 401(k) first due to higher contribution limits
- If your employer offers matching, this provides an immediate 100% return on those matched funds

**Second priority: Max out a Roth IRA**
- Results #1, #15, #32, and #33 all strongly recommend Roth accounts for someone in your situation
- As a young person planning to retire in your 50s, the tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement are highly valuable
- The findings consistently suggest that those expecting to retire in their 50s benefit significantly from Roth accounts
- Current Roth IRA contribution limits are $6,500 annually (under 50)

**Third priority: Return to your 401(k) and contribute beyond the match**
- If you can afford to contribute more after maxing out your Roth, return to your 401(k) to reach the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023)
- The traditional 401(k) provides immediate tax deductions, lowering your current taxable income

**Fourth priority: Taxable brokerage account for index fund investing**
- Only after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts should you consider a taxable brokerage account
- Result #11 suggests it rarely makes sense to fund taxable accounts before fully funding tax-advantaged options
- Here you can implement the index fund strategy mentioned in results #35 and #20

### 2. Addressing Inflation in Your Strategy

Current inflation rates require specific considerations in your retirement planning:

- **Investment allocation**: With a 27-year timeline, you can afford an aggressive allocation that historically outpaces inflation. Results #4 and #36 mention aggressive approaches for early retirement.

- **Diversification**: As noted in result #3, diversification is crucial. Consider a mix of:
  - Stock index funds (for growth that outpaces inflation)
  - Some bond allocation (result #4 mentions VBTLX, a total bond market fund)
  - Possibly a small allocation to inflation-protected securities like TIPS

- **Dollar-cost averaging**: Result #4 and #36 mention DCA as a strategy, which helps mitigate the impact of inflation and market volatility over time.

- **Cash reserves**: Result #21 recommends having 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid account, though in high inflation environments, minimize this to what you truly need as cash loses purchasing power (result #22).

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

1. **Immediate actions**:
   - Ensure you're contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match
   - Open a Roth IRA if you don't have one and set up automatic contributions to max it out annually
   - Build a modest emergency fund (3-6 months expenses) in a high-yield savings account

2. **Investment selection within accounts**:
   - Within both your 401(k) and Roth IRA, choose low-cost, diversified investments:
     - Target-date retirement funds (if available in your 401(k))
     - Or a combination of total stock market index funds and total bond market index funds
   - In your taxable brokerage, use tax-efficient index funds/ETFs

3. **Ongoing strategy**:
   - Automate contributions to reach your savings goals (aim for 15-20% of income based on results #3, #6, #9)
   - Rebalance your portfolio annually
   - Consider Roth conversion strategies in early retirement (results #5, #15, #17)

## Specific Recommendation

Given your age, savings, and goal to retire by 55, here's your optimal approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match
2. **Roth IRA**: Max out annually ($6,500)
3. **401(k)**: If you can afford more, increase 401(k) contributions to the annual limit
4. **Taxable brokerage**: Only after steps 1-3 are complete, invest in low-cost, tax-efficient index funds

This sequence maximizes tax advantages while building a diversified portfolio that should outpace inflation over your 27-year accumulation period. With consistent contributions and an appropriate asset allocation, you should be well-positioned to achieve your goal of retiring by 55.
