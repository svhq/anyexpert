The presence of the -OH group in 1-propanol allows for extensive hydrogen bonding networks between molecules, requiring more energy (higher temperature) to break these interactions during the boiling process.\n\nThe expected boiling points would follow this order:\n1-propanol > dimethyl ether ≈ fluoroethane > propane\n\nTherefore, the compound expected to have the highest boiling point is:\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂CH₂OH (1-propanol)**",

        "B) A statement by a party-opponent is not hearsay",

      "model_response": "\n**Professor Eleanor Vance, Evidence Law Scholar**\n\nAfter careful analysis of the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), I can confirm that the correct answer is **Option B: \"A statement by a party-opponent is not hearsay.\"**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n**Option A: Hearsay is always admissible if the declarant is unavailable**\nThis statement is incorrect. While FRE 804 outlines several exceptions that apply when the declarant is unavailable (such as former testimony, dying declarations, and statements against interest), not all exceptions require unavailability. For example, FRE 803 contains numerous exceptions that don't depend on the declarant's availability (e.g., present sense impression, excited utterance, records of regularly conducted activity). Unavailability alone doesn't automatically make hearsay admissible.\n\n**Option B: A statement by a party-opponent is not hearsay**\nThis statement is correct. Under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against an opposing party and was made by the party in an individual or representative capacity. This is known as the \"party-opponent rule\" or \"admission by a party-opponent.\" The rationale is that parties should be bound by their own statements, and thus such statements are not considered hearsay because they are not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted but rather as an admission by the party.\n\n**Option C: Hearsay is any out-of-court statement**\nThis statement is incomplete and therefore incorrect. While hearsay typically involves an out-of-court statement, FRE 801 provides a more precise definition: \"Hearsay is a statement that the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing and a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.\" The key element is that the statement must be offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Out-of-court statements offered for other purposes (such as effect on the listener or to show knowledge) are not hearsay.\n\n**Option C: Business records are always hearsay**\nThis statement is incorrect. Business records are hearsay, but they are not \"always\" hearsay in the sense that they are excluded. Instead, FRE 803(6) provides a specific exception to the hearsay rule for business records, making them admissible if certain requirements are met (e.g., made at or near the time by someone with knowledge, kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, etc.). So business records are an exception to the hearsay rule, not \"always\" hearsay.\n\nIn conclusion, Option B is the only statement that accurately reflects the Federal Rules of Evidence regarding hearsay.",

It essentially answers the question \"How many people developed this disease during a particular time frame?\" This is a measure of disease risk and is crucial for studying causes and prevention.\n\n- **Prevalence rate**, by contrast, measures the TOTAL number of existing cases (both new and pre-existing) in a population at a SPECIFIC point in time (point prevalence) or during a specified period (period prevalence). It answers \"How many people currently have this disease?\"\n\nLet me clarify why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA) This describes prevalence, not incidence. Prevalence counts all existing cases at a point in time.\n\nC) This describes mortality rate, which measures deaths from a disease, not new cases.\n\nD) This refers to the population at risk, which is the denominator in calculating incidence (new cases ÷ population at risk), but is not what incidence itself measures.\n\nIncidence is a dynamic measure that reflects the transition from healthy to diseased state, making it fundamental for understanding disease etiology and evaluating preventive interventions.",

This principle states that revenue should be recognized when:\n\n1. **The earnings process is substantially complete** - This means the company has delivered the goods or performed the services that it agreed to provide to the customer. The company has fulfilled its obligations under the sales contract or agreement.\n\n2. **Collection is reasonably assured** - This means the company has reasonable evidence that it will receive payment from the customer. This is typically evidenced by factors such as the customer's credit history, past payment patterns, or written promises to pay.\n\nLet me explain why the other options are incorrect:\n\n- **A) Cash is received from the customer**: This describes the cash basis of accounting, not accrual accounting. Under cash basis, revenue is recognized only when cash is actually received, regardless of when the goods or services were provided.\n\n- **C) The invoice is sent to the customer**: Simply sending an invoice does not complete the earnings process. The company might not have delivered the goods or services yet, so revenue should not be recognized at this point.\n\n- **D) The fiscal year ends**: The end of a fiscal year is merely a reporting date, not the criterion for revenue recognition. Revenue should be recognized when the criteria in option B are met, regardless of when that falls in relation to the fiscal year.\n\nThe revenue recognition principle ensures that financial statements accurately reflect the economic activities of a company during a specific period, providing a more accurate picture of financial performance than would be possible under cash basis accounting.",

This occurs when the conditioned stimulus is presented again following a pause in extinction training.\n\nLet me clarify why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Generalization: This occurs when a conditioned response is elicited by stimuli similar to the original conditioned stimulus, not after extinction has occurred.\n\nB) Discrimination: This is the ability to distinguish between the conditioned stimulus and other similar stimuli, showing the response only to the specific conditioned stimulus.\n\nD) Higher-order conditioning: This refers to a new neutral stimulus becoming a conditioned stimulus by being paired with an already established conditioned stimulus.\n\nSpontaneous recovery demonstrates that extinction doesn't erase the original learning but rather inhibits it. When given time to rest, the inhibition weakens, allowing the original conditioned response to re-emerge, though typically at a reduced intensity compared to before extinction.\n\nThis phenomenon was first systematically described by Ivan Pavlov, the Russian physiologist who pioneered the study of classical conditioning, and remains an important concept in understanding how learning and memory work.\n\n**Final Answer: C) Spontaneous recovery**",

Many tables with primary keys still violate 3NF due to transitive dependencies.\n\n**Option B: \"It is in 2NF and has no transitive dependencies\"**\nThis is the precise definition of 3NF. Let me elaborate:\n- A table must first be in 2NF, which means it must be in 1NF (all attributes are atomic) and have no partial dependencies (no non-key attribute depends on only part of a composite primary key).\n- Additionally, for 3NF, the table must have no transitive dependencies. A transitive dependency occurs when a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute rather than directly on the primary key.\n\n**Option C: \"All attributes are atomic\"**\nThis describes First Normal Form (1NF), which is the most basic level of normalization. While 3NF tables must be in 1NF, this condition alone doesn't guarantee 3NF.\n\n**Option D: \"It has no null values\"**\nNull values have no direct relationship with normal forms. A table in 3NF can contain null values, and avoiding nulls is a design consideration separate from normalization.\n\nTo summarize, 3NF builds upon 2NF by eliminating transitive dependencies, ensuring that all non-key attributes depend directly on the primary key and not on other non-key attributes.",

Let me break down why this is the correct answer:\n\n1. The theorem specifically states that when property rights are well-defined and transaction costs are zero, private parties can negotiate efficient solutions to externality problems without government intervention.\n\n2.
