As Professor Eleanor Vance, a specialist in Abstract Algebra, I have analyzed both statements based on the fundamental definitions and properties of ring theory.

**Analysis of Statement 1:** "A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}."

This statement is a fundamental theorem in the study of ring homomorphisms, directly analogous to the relationship between injectivity and the trivial kernel in group theory and linear algebra. Let's confirm its validity.

A ring homomorphism $\phi: R \to S$ is a function that preserves ring operations. The kernel of $\phi$, denoted $\ker(\phi)$, is the set of elements in $R$ that map to the additive identity ($0_S$) in $S$: $\ker(\phi) = \{r \in R \mid \phi(r) = 0_S\}$.

We need to prove two implications:

1.  **If $\phi$ is one-to-one (injective), then $\ker(\phi) = \{0_R\}$:**
    If $\phi$ is injective, then for any $a, b \in R$, $\phi(a) = \phi(b)$ implies $a = b$.
    We know that for any ring homomorphism, $\phi(0_R) = 0_S$.
    If $x \in \ker(\phi)$, then by definition, $\phi(x) = 0_S$.
    Since $\phi(0_R) = 0_S$, we have $\phi(x) = \phi(0_R)$.
    Due to the injectivity of $\phi$, this equality implies $x = 0_R$.
    Therefore, the only element in the kernel is the additive identity of $R$, meaning $\ker(\phi) = \{0_R\}$.

2.  **If $\ker(\phi) = \{0_R\}$, then $\phi$ is one-to-one:**
    If $\ker(\phi) = \{0_R\}$, it means $0_R$ is the only element in $R$ that maps to $0_S$.
    Suppose we have $a, b \in R$ such that $\phi(a) = \phi(b)$.
    Subtracting $\phi(b)$ from both sides yields $\phi(a) - \phi(b) = 0_S$.
    Since $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism, it preserves subtraction: $\phi(a - b) = \phi(a) - \phi(b)$.
    Thus, $\phi(a - b) = 0_S$.
    This implies that $(a - b) \in \ker(\phi)$.
    Given that $\ker(\phi) = \{0_R\}$, we must have $a - b = 0_R$.
    Adding $b$ to both sides gives $a = b$.
    Therefore, $\phi$ is one-to-one.

Both directions are proven true. Thus, **Statement 1 is True**. This is a standard result in abstract algebra texts [1].

**Analysis of Statement 2:** "Q is an ideal in R."

In the usual context of number systems and abstract algebra:
*   "Q" represents the set of rational numbers, denoted by $\mathbb{Q}$.
*   "R" represents the set of real numbers, denoted by $\mathbb{R}$.

For $\mathbb{Q}$ to be an ideal of $\mathbb{R}$, it must satisfy the definition of an ideal within the ring $\mathbb{R}$. An ideal $I$ of a ring $R$ must be:
1.  An additive subgroup of $R$.
2.  Absorbing under multiplication by any element of $R$; that is, for all $a \in I$ and $r \in R$, both $ra \in I$ and $ar \in I$.

Let's examine these conditions for $\mathbb{Q}$ as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$:

1.  **Additive Subgroup:** $\mathbb{Q}$ is non-empty (e.g., $0 \in \mathbb{Q}$), and for any $a, b \in \mathbb{Q}$, $a-b$ is also a rational number, so $a-b \in \mathbb{Q}$. Thus, $\mathbb{Q}$ is an additive subgroup of $\mathbb{R}$.

2.  **Absorption Property:** We need to check if for any $a \in \mathbb{Q}$ and any $r \in \mathbb{R}$, the product $ra$ is also in $\mathbb{Q}$.
    Consider $a = 1$, which is a rational number ($1 \in \mathbb{Q}$).
    Consider $r = \sqrt{2}$, which is a real number ($r \in \mathbb{R}$).
    The product $ra = \sqrt{2} \cdot 1 = \sqrt{2}$.
    However, $\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number, meaning $\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}$.
    Since we found an element $a \in \mathbb{Q}$ and an element $r \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $ra \notin \mathbb{Q}$, the absorption property fails.

Therefore, $\mathbb{Q}$ is not an ideal of $\mathbb{R}$. $\mathbb{Q}$ is a subring of $\mathbb{R}$, and both are fields, but $\mathbb{Q}$ does not satisfy the definition of an ideal in $\mathbb{R}$. This is a standard result in abstract algebra [2].

Thus, **Statement 2 is False**.

**Conclusion:**

Statement 1 is True.
Statement 2 is False.

This combination corresponds to option (A).

The final answer is $\boxed{A}$.
