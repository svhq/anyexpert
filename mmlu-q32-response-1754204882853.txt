As Dr. Evelyn Reed, a Professor of Inorganic Chemistry specializing in chemical bonding and molecular structure, I can definitively determine which of the provided options has an octet of electrons around the central atom.

The octet rule states that atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve a stable configuration of eight valence electrons, similar to noble gases [14, 21, 22, 25, 29]. To answer this question, we need to examine the Lewis structure and electron count around the central atom for each molecule or ion.

Let's analyze each option:

*   **(A) BF₃ (Boron Trifluoride)**
    Boron (B) is in Group 13 and has 3 valence electrons. Fluorine (F) is in Group 17 and has 7 valence electrons. In BF₃, Boron is the central atom, bonded to three Fluorine atoms. Each B-F bond is a single covalent bond, meaning Boron shares one electron with each Fluorine.
    *   Boron contributes 3 valence electrons.
    *   Each Fluorine contributes 1 electron to the bond with Boron.
    *   Total electrons around Boron = 3 (from B) + 3 (shared from F) = 6 electrons.
    Boron in BF₃ has an incomplete octet [33, 39].

*   **(B) BeF₂ (Beryllium Fluoride)**
    Beryllium (Be) is in Group 2 and has 2 valence electrons. Fluorine (F) has 7 valence electrons. In BeF₂, Beryllium is the central atom, bonded to two Fluorine atoms. Each Be-F bond is a single covalent bond.
    *   Beryllium contributes 2 valence electrons.
    *   Each Fluorine contributes 1 electron to the bond with Beryllium.
    *   Total electrons around Beryllium = 2 (from Be) + 2 (shared from F) = 4 electrons.
    Beryllium in BeF₂ has an incomplete octet [33, 39].

*   **(C) PF₅ (Phosphorus Pentafluoride)**
    Phosphorus (P) is in Group 15 and has 5 valence electrons. Fluorine (F) has 7 valence electrons. In PF₅, Phosphorus is the central atom, bonded to five Fluorine atoms. Each P-F bond is a single covalent bond.
    *   Phosphorus contributes 5 valence electrons.
    *   Each Fluorine contributes 1 electron to the bond with Phosphorus.
    *   Total electrons around Phosphorus = 5 (from P) + 5 (shared from F) = 10 electrons.
    Phosphorus in PF₅ has an expanded octet [5, 10, 11, 32, 40].

*   **(D) NH₄⁺ (Ammonium Ion)**
    Nitrogen (N) is in Group 15 and has 5 valence electrons. Hydrogen (H) has 1 valence electron. The ion has a +1 charge, meaning it has lost one electron. In NH₄⁺, Nitrogen is the central atom, bonded to four Hydrogen atoms. Each N-H bond is a single covalent bond.
    *   Nitrogen contributes 5 valence electrons.
    *   Each Hydrogen contributes 1 electron to the bond with Nitrogen.
    *   Total valence electrons for the neutral NH₄ molecule = 5 (N) + 4 * 1 (H) = 9 electrons.
    *   Due to the +1 charge, we remove 1 electron: 9 - 1 = 8 valence electrons in total.
    *   When forming bonds with four Hydrogens, Nitrogen shares one electron with each Hydrogen.
    *   Total electrons around Nitrogen = 4 (shared from N) + 4 (shared from H) = 8 electrons.
    The nitrogen atom in NH₄⁺ has a complete octet.

*   **(E) SF₆ (Sulfur Hexafluoride)**
    Sulfur (S) is in Group 16 and has 6 valence electrons. Fluorine (F) has 7 valence electrons. In SF₆, Sulfur is the central atom, bonded to six Fluorine atoms. Each S-F bond is a single covalent bond.
    *   Sulfur contributes 6 valence electrons.
    *   Each Fluorine contributes 1 electron to the bond with Sulfur.
    *   Total electrons around Sulfur = 6 (from S) + 6 (shared from F) = 12 electrons.
    Sulfur in SF₆ has an expanded octet [5, 10, 11, 32, 40].

Based on this analysis, the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺) is the only species among the options where the central atom (Nitrogen) has an octet of electrons.

The final answer is **(D) NH₄⁺**.
