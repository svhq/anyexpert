Let's break down this reaction sequence step-by-step to determine the structure and, consequently, the number of carbon atoms in Product 3.

**Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde treated with methylmagnesium bromide**

*   **trans-cinnamaldehyde:** This molecule has the structure $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5-\text{CH}=\text{CH}-\text{CHO}$. It consists of a phenyl group (6 carbons), two carbons in the vinyl double bond, and an aldehyde carbon. In total, trans-cinnamaldehyde has **9 carbon atoms**.
*   **Methylmagnesium bromide ($\text{CH}_3\text{MgBr}$):** This is a Grignard reagent, acting as a nucleophilic source of a methyl group ($\text{CH}_3^-$). Grignard reagents typically undergo 1,2-addition to the carbonyl carbon of aldehydes and ketones.
*   **Reaction:** The methyl group from methylmagnesium bromide attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of trans-cinnamaldehyde.
*   **Product 1:** After aqueous acidic workup, the alkoxide intermediate is protonated, yielding a secondary allylic alcohol: $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5-\text{CH}=\text{CH}-\text{CH}(\text{OH})-\text{CH}_3$.
    The total number of carbon atoms in Product 1 is the 9 carbons from trans-cinnamaldehyde plus the 1 carbon from the methyl group, resulting in **10 carbon atoms**.

**Step 2: Product 1 treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**

*   **Product 1:** $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5-\text{CH}=\text{CH}-\text{CH}(\text{OH})-\text{CH}_3$ is a secondary alcohol.
*   **PCC (Pyridinium Chlorochromate):** PCC is a mild oxidizing agent commonly used to oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones.
*   **Reaction:** PCC oxidizes the secondary alcohol group in Product 1 to a ketone.
*   **Product 2:** The resulting molecule is an $\alpha,\beta$-unsaturated ketone: $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5-\text{CH}=\text{CH}-\text{C}(=\text{O})-\text{CH}_3$.
    The number of carbon atoms remains **10 carbon atoms**, as no carbons were added or removed, only the functional group changed oxidation state.

**Step 3: Product 2 treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature**

*   **Product 2:** $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5-\text{CH}=\text{CH}-\text{C}(=\text{O})-\text{CH}_3$ is an $\alpha,\beta$-unsaturated ketone (enone).
*   **(dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane:** This is the IUPAC name for **dimethylsulfoxonium methylide**, with the structure $(\text{CH}_3)_2\text{S}^+(=\text{O})-\text{CH}_2^-$. This is a sulfur ylide reagent.
*   **Reaction:** The Corey-Chaykovsky reaction involves the treatment of carbonyl compounds or enones with sulfur ylides. With $\alpha,\beta$-unsaturated ketones, dimethylsulfoxonium methylide typically undergoes conjugate addition to the $\beta$-carbon, followed by intramolecular cyclization where the enolate attacks the sulfur atom. This process displaces dimethyl sulfoxide ($\text{S}(=\text{O})(\text{CH}_3)_2$) and forms an epoxide across the original double bond [1].
*   **Product 3:** The reaction yields an epoxy ketone. The structure of Product 3 is formed by the insertion of the methylene group ($\text{CH}_2$) from the ylide into the $\text{C}=\text{C}$ double bond, creating a three-membered epoxide ring. The phenyl group remains attached to one carbon of the epoxide, the carbonyl group remains intact, and the methyl group is attached to the carbonyl.

    The structure of Product 3 is:
    $$
    \text{C}_6\text{H}_5-\underset{\beta}{\text{CH}} - \underset{\text{CH}_2 (\text{from ylide})}{\text{CH}_2}
    \qquad | \quad / $
    $\qquad \underset{\alpha}{\text{C}} - \text{CH}_3$
    $\qquad \quad ||$
    $\qquad \quad \text{O}$
    $$
    Here, $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5$ is the phenyl group. The $\text{CH}$ atom attached to the phenyl group is the original $\beta$-carbon of Product 2. The $\text{CH}_2$ group is the one provided by the ylide. The $\text{C}$ atom is the original $\alpha$-carbon (now the carbonyl carbon), and the $\text{CH}_3$ is the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

*   **Carbon Atom Count in Product 3:**
    *   Phenyl group ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5$): 6 carbons
    *   Original $\beta$-carbon (now one carbon of the epoxide ring): 1 carbon
    *   Methylene group from the ylide (now the other carbon of the epoxide ring): 1 carbon
    *   Original $\alpha$-carbon (now the carbonyl carbon): 1 carbon
    *   Methyl group attached to the carbonyl: 1 carbon

    Summing these up: $6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = \mathbf{10}$ carbon atoms.

Therefore, Product 3 contains 10 carbon atoms.

The final answer is $\boxed{10}$.
