As **Professor Evelyn Reed, a specialist in Moral Philosophy**, I can definitively state that according to Immanuel Kant, the supreme principle of morality is **synthetic and a priori**.

Let's break down why this is the case, drawing upon Kant's philosophical framework and the provided research:

1.  **The Supreme Principle of Morality:** Kant identified the supreme principle of morality as the **Categorical Imperative (CI)** [2, 11, 21, 22, 31, 33, 36]. This principle serves as a universal ethical rule that guides our actions, irrespective of our personal desires or goals. It is a principle of practical rationality that dictates how we *ought* to act [2, 11, 23, 38].

2.  **Analytic vs. Synthetic Judgments:**
    *   **Analytic judgments** are those where the predicate is already contained within the concept of the subject. For example, "All bachelors are unmarried" [1]. The truth of such statements can be determined by analyzing the meaning of the terms involved.
    *   **Synthetic judgments**, on the other hand, add new information to the subject. The predicate is not contained within the concept of the subject but is connected to it through experience or some other means [1, 7]. For instance, "This ball is red" is synthetic because the concept of "ball" does not inherently include "redness."

3.  **A Priori vs. A Posteriori Knowledge:**
    *   **A priori knowledge** is independent of experience; it is necessary and universal [10]. We can know these truths through reason alone, without needing to consult the empirical world.
    *   **A posteriori knowledge** is derived from experience and is contingent. It is particular and can vary [10].

4.  **Kant's Argument for Synthetic A Priori Morality:**
    *   Kant argued that the supreme principle of morality **cannot be analytic** because if it were, it would merely be a clarification of existing moral concepts, not a substantive moral law that compels us to act. A truly supreme principle of morality must add something new, a prescription for action, rather than just defining terms [3, 16].
    *   Furthermore, Kant contended that moral principles must be **a priori**. If morality were based on empirical experience (a posteriori), it would be contingent and subject to change, failing to provide a universal and necessary foundation for moral obligation [3, 10, 15]. Morality, for Kant, must be grounded in reason, which is universal and necessary [28, 29].
    *   Therefore, Kant concluded that the Categorical Imperative must be a **synthetic a priori** proposition [3, 8, 9, 16, 18]. It is synthetic because it connects our will (the subject) to a prescription for action (the predicate) that is not analytically contained within the concept of a "will" or "rational agent" itself. It is a priori because its validity is not dependent on any particular experience but is established through reason alone, making it necessary and universal [3, 7, 10].

In summary, the Categorical Imperative, as Kant's supreme principle of morality, is a statement that is both informative (synthetic) and universally binding (a priori).

The correct option is therefore:

**(C) synthetic and a priori.**
