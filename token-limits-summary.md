# Token Limits Fix Summary

## Issue Found
The modular agent had very restrictive token limits that were causing responses to be truncated:
- Planning phase: 300 tokens
- Code execution: 1000 tokens  
- Reasoning: 1500 tokens
- Synthesis: 2000 tokens
- Default: 1000 tokens
- OpenRouter service default: 8000 tokens

Compare to original agent: 50000 tokens

## Fix Applied
Increased token limits to reasonable levels that balance completeness with response time:
- All phases now use: 8000 tokens
- Default fallback: 16000 tokens
- OpenRouter service: 16000 tokens

## Impact on UI/UX
- Users will now see complete responses without truncation
- Complex mathematical solutions and detailed explanations will display fully
- Multi-step reasoning will not be cut off mid-explanation
- Response times may be slightly longer but responses will be complete

## Recommendations
1. Monitor response times with new limits
2. Consider implementing streaming responses for better UX
3. Add a loading indicator for longer responses
4. Consider model-specific optimizations (some models handle long outputs better)

## Testing
The AIME geometry problem that was getting truncated should now display the complete solution including the final answer.
