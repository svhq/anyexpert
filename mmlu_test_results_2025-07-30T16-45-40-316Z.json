For example:\n\n- \"Safe practices\" are encouraged, so adverts must not *encourage unsafe practices* (ruling out options that say \"Safe practices\"),\n- Regulatory concerns focus on avoiding \"distress\" and \"fear,\" not \"joy\" or \"wants,\"\n- Offence is generally qualified as \"serious\" rather than \"trivial\" to signal the threshold for regulatory concern.\n\nThus, option I precisely matches the typical phrasing used in advertising regulations.",

Many important Hanseatic cities included Lübeck, Hamburg, Bergen, Novgorod, Riga, Danzig (Gdansk), Visby, Cologne, and Stockholm[1][3][5].\n\n- **Amsterdam**, while a major trading city in the Low Countries, was historically *not* a major member of the Hanseatic League. It developed into a dominant trading hub later, during the Dutch Golden Age in the 17th century, but it was not a central Hanseatic city. The League’s influence in the Netherlands was more focused on cities like Bruges and other Flemish ports[3].\n\n- Other cities listed here were well-known Hanseatic members:\n\n  - **Lübeck**: Often called the “Queen of the Hanse” and central to the League’s foundation[1][2].\n  \n  - **Hamburg**: A key port and trading center in the League[1].\n  \n  - **Bergen**: The main Norwegian Hanseatic port on the North Atlantic[1].\n  \n  - **Novgorod**: The easternmost major Hanseatic trade city in Russia[1][4].\n  \n  - **Riga**, **Danzig (Gdansk)**, **Visby**, and **Stockholm**: Important Baltic Hanseatic cities[1][2][3].\n  \n  - **Cologne**: A Hanseatic city in the Rhineland quarter despite some conflicts during the Anglo-Hanseatic War, still considered a member[3].\n\nThus, **Amsterdam** was *not* a major member of the Hanseatic League.\n\n**Final answer:** E) Amsterdam",

They can perform operational thought such as classification, reversibility, and cause-effect relationships but struggle with abstract or hypothetical reasoning[1][2][3][4].\n- **Formal operational stage (12+ years):** Adolescents develop the capacity for abstract thinking, hypotheticals, and scientific reasoning[1][2][4].\n\nOther options like the postformal stage (E) are debated and typically considered beyond Piaget's original four stages; symbolic, intuitive, schematic, abstract, and logical stages (F-J) are not standard Piagetian stages.\n\nThus, since the child can think logically about concrete things but struggles with abstract hypothetical thinking, this fits perfectly with the **Concrete operational stage (C)**.",

This is because:\n\n- If MR > MC, producing more increases profit since each additional unit adds more to revenue than cost.\n- If MC > MR, producing more reduces profit since the cost of an additional unit exceeds the revenue it generates.\n- Therefore, at **MC = MR**, the firm cannot increase profit by changing output; this is the profit-maximizing (or loss-minimizing) output level[1][2][3][4].\n\nOther options explained briefly:\n\n- A) Maximum total revenue: Occurs where MR = 0, not where MR = MC.\n- B) Minimum average cost: Related to cost curves, not directly to MR=MC.\n- D) Break-even point: Where total revenue equals total cost, not specifically MR=MC.\n- E) Maximum marginal utility: A consumer concept, not firm production.\n- F) Minimum marginal cost: Refers to cost minimization, not profit maximization.\n- G) Economic equilibrium: Broader market concept, not just firm output decision.\n- H) Price ceiling: Government price control, unrelated to MR=MC.\n- I) Consumer surplus maximization: Consumer-side concept, not firm production.\n- J) Market failure: Economic inefficiency, unrelated to MR=MC.\n\nThus, **MC = MR** is the fundamental condition for a firm to maximize profit or minimize losses in microeconomic theory.",

        "content": "The **worst-case time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is \\(O(n \\log n)\\)**.\n\nMerge sort works by recursively dividing the array into halves until each subarray has one element, then merging these subarrays back together in sorted order. Each level of recursion involves merging all elements, which takes linear time \\(O(n)\\), and the number of levels of recursion is proportional to \\(\\log n\\) because the array is repeatedly halved. Therefore, the total time complexity is the product of these two factors: \\(O(n) \\times O(\\log n) = O(n \\log n)\\).\n\nThis complexity holds in the worst case because merge sort always performs the same divide-and-merge steps regardless of the initial order of elements, including the worst-case scenarios such as reverse-sorted arrays or interleaved subarrays requiring maximum comparisons during merging[1][2][3][4].\n\nAmong the given options, the correct answer is:\n\n**B) O(n log n)**",

        "content": "The correct answer is **B) Act only according to maxims that you could will to become universal laws**.\n\nThis option precisely states Kant's principle of universalizability, which is the core of the first formulation of his categorical imperative. According to Kant, a moral action is one whose guiding maxim (or principle) can be consistently willed to be a universal law — meaning everyone could follow the same rule without contradiction or undermining the practice itself[1][2][3][4].\n\nTo clarify why the others are incorrect:\n\n- A) Reflects utilitarianism, focusing on greatest happiness, not Kantian ethics.\n- C) Refers to acting on natural desires, which Kant rejects as a moral basis.\n- D) Suggests consequentialism, which Kant contrasts with his deontological approach.\n- E) Emphasizes social conventions, but Kant’s principle is independent of social norms.\n- F) Divine command theory is a different moral framework.\n- G) Personal virtue and character ethics are more Aristotelian than Kantian.\n- H) Rational self-interest aligns with ethical egoism, not Kant’s universal law.\n- I) Cultural relativism denies universal moral laws, opposite to Kant’s universalizability.\n- J) Emotional intuition is a non-rational basis, which Kant excludes from morality.\n\nHence, only option B captures Kant’s universalizability principle faithfully.",

        "content": "The correct answer is **C) Stiffness or resistance to elastic deformation**.\n\nYoung's modulus (modulus of elasticity) is a fundamental mechanical property that measures a material's stiffness—how much it resists elastic (reversible) deformation when subjected to tensile or compressive stress. It is defined as the ratio of stress (force per unit area) to strain (proportional deformation) within the material's linear elastic region, meaning the deformation is temporary and the material returns to its original shape once the load is removed[1][2][3][5].\n\nThis property does *not* measure:\n\n- Heat conduction (A),\n- Plastic deformation resistance (B) — which relates to yield strength or hardness,\n- Maximum stress before failure (D) — which is the ultimate tensile strength,\n- Density (E),\n- Thermal expansion (F),\n- Electrical conductivity (G),\n- Corrosion resistance (H),\n- Hardness on the Mohs scale (I),\n- Magnetic permeability (J).\n\nIn summary, Young's modulus is specifically about **how stiff a material is in its elastic range**, quantifying its resistance to elastic deformation under axial loading[1][2][3][5].",
