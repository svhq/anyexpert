As Dr. Elena Vasquez, Professor of Medieval European History at the University of Heidelberg, I continue to draw upon my expertise in the economic and political structures of late medieval and early modern Europe. My focus on trade networks like the Hanseatic League allows me to provide a precise and evidence-based response to your query. Building on the detailed analysis we've already established, I'll consolidate the key findings into a comprehensive final answer, ensuring clarity, historical accuracy, and proper citation of sources.

### Comprehensive Final Answer

To determine which city was not a major member of the Hanseatic League—a confederation of merchant cities that dominated Baltic and North Sea trade from the 13th to 17th centuries—we must evaluate the historical evidence systematically. The League's membership was informal, based on participation in assemblies, mutual defense, and economic alliances, rather than rigid formal charters. Drawing from primary sources such as League assembly records (e.g., from the Lübeck archives) and secondary analyses by historians like Philippe Dollinger [1] and Wim Blockmans [2], I'll revisit the options step by step to confirm the outlier.

#### Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **Contextual Foundation**: The Hanseatic League comprised cities in Northern Europe, primarily in modern-day Germany, Scandinavia, and the Baltic region. Major members were those that actively contributed to the League's governance, trade kontors (outposts), and defensive efforts. Cities like Lübeck served as central hubs, while others joined through economic ties.

2. **Assessment of Each Option**:
   - **A) Lübeck**: Undisputed as the League's core city, Lübeck hosted key assemblies and was instrumental in treaties like the 1367 Treaty of Stralsund. Historical records, including League minutes, affirm its foundational role [1].
   - **B) Hamburg**: A key member from the 13th century, Hamburg participated in trade fairs and anti-piracy operations, as documented in Hanseatic chronicles.
   - **C) Bergen**: While more of a kontor in Norway, Bergen was deeply integrated into the League's fish trade network from the 14th century, evidenced by the Bergen Wharf's operations [2].
   - **D) Novgorod**: As a Russian trading partner, Novgorod maintained a kontor and treaty relations but was not a formal member due to its external political context; it was still a significant ally [1].
   - **E) Amsterdam**: Emerging as a major trade center in the 17th century during the Dutch Golden Age, Amsterdam was part of rival Dutch networks, such as those of the Dutch East India Company. It never joined the League, instead competing against it, as noted in Dollinger's analysis of the League's decline [1].
   - **F) Riga**: A full member from the 13th century, Riga's role in grain and timber trade is well-documented in League records.
   - **G) Danzig (Gdansk)**: Joined in the 14th century and controlled vital grain routes, with extensive evidence from League conflicts and trade agreements [2].
   - **H) Visby**: An early 12th-century member on Gotland, Sweden, influential in salt and cloth trades until its decline, per Hanseatic histories.
   - **I) Cologne**: Actively involved from the 13th century via its Rhine River trade, as confirmed by assembly participation records.
   - **J) Stockholm**: A 14th-century member active in fur and iron trades, though its involvement waned with Swedish independence [1].

3. **Identification of the Outlier**: Based on timelines and historical sources, Amsterdam's prominence post-dates the League's peak and aligns with competing trade systems. This is supported by evidence from Dollinger's "The German Hansa" [1], which highlights the League's rivalry with Dutch cities, and Blockmans' works on medieval trade dynamics [2].

In summary, the evidence clearly identifies Amsterdam as the city that was not a major member, underscoring the League's focus on Northern European alliances and the rise of alternative trade powers.

**Final Answer**: The city that was NOT a major member of the Hanseatic League is **E) Amsterdam**.
