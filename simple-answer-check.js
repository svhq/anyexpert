  "A large gene has dozens of exons, of which the central ones code for folded triple helical repeats that connect the cytoskeleton with sarcolemma and extracellular space. Each exon usually codes for one folded triple alpha helix. The most common mutations of the gene are central exon deletions that create out-of-frame peptides and progressive degenerative organ waste. A solution is to deliver a Morpholino that recognizes the 5' end of the out-of-frame exon in pre-mRNA. The molecule prevents binding of the spliceosome and creates exon skipping and in-frame joining. Several missing exons are well tolerated by an organism. Which structure below is not involved in the proposed therapy?",
  
  "Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?",
  
  "trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1. 1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2. 3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3. how many carbon atoms are there in product 3?",
  
  "To investigate the causes of a complex genetic disease, you culture patient cells and carry out DNA sequencing to detect mutations in candidate genes. This revealed a mutation in the gene HOXB2 that is only present in the patient cells and not the healthy controls. To learn more about the role of this mutation in the disease, you want to explore the relationship between chromatin structure and gene expression in patient cells and compare your results to healthy cells. Which of the following combinations of methods would provide you with results that would help your investigations?",
  
  "A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|up‚ü©+‚àö3/2|down‚ü© of its spin-up and spin-down states. If |up‚ü© and |down‚ü© are the eigenstates of œÉ_z , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator 10œÉ_z+5œÉ_x ? Here, symbols have their usual meanings"
