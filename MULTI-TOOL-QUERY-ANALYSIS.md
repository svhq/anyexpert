# Multi-Tool Query Testing Analysis

## Date: 2025-08-03

### Overview
Tested 3 complex realistic queries designed to encourage multi-tool usage with the improved unified agent.

## Query Results Summary

### ‚úÖ Query 1: Current Events + Calculation (Olympics Medal Count)
- **Duration**: 23.3 seconds
- **Tools Used**: parallel ‚Üí search ‚Üí code
- **Multi-tool**: ‚úÖ YES (used 3 unique tools)
- **Parallel Execution**: ‚úÖ YES
- **Tokens Used**: 7,923
- **Key Achievement**: Successfully used parallel execution on first step

**Analysis**: This query perfectly demonstrated the improved agent's capabilities:
1. The planner correctly identified the need for both search (current event data) and code (calculations)
2. **Parallel execution was triggered** - search and code ran simultaneously on the first step
3. Additional search rounds were used to gather more specific data
4. Final code execution performed the percentage calculations

### ‚úÖ Query 2: Scientific Research + Verification (Telomere & Statistics)
- **Duration**: 31.5 seconds
- **Tools Used**: parallel ‚Üí search ‚Üí search ‚Üí search ‚Üí code
- **Multi-tool**: ‚úÖ YES (used 3 unique tools)
- **Parallel Execution**: ‚úÖ YES
- **Tokens Used**: 11,852
- **Key Achievement**: Combined research gathering with statistical verification

**Analysis**: Another successful multi-tool execution:
1. Parallel execution on first step (search + code preparation)
2. Multiple search rounds to gather comprehensive research on telomeres
3. Code execution for t-test statistical calculation
4. The model correctly calculated SEM, t-statistic (36.59), and p-value

### ‚ùå Query 3: Coding Implementation + Optimization (Sieve of Eratosthenes)
- **Duration**: 67.9 seconds
- **Tools Used**: code ‚Üí code ‚Üí code ‚Üí code ‚Üí code ‚Üí code
- **Multi-tool**: ‚ùå NO (only used code)
- **Parallel Execution**: ‚ùå NO
- **Tokens Used**: 23,749
- **Key Achievement**: Comprehensive implementation with benchmarking

**Analysis**: While the response was excellent, it didn't use multiple tools:
1. The planner correctly identified this as a pure coding task
2. Six iterations of code execution for implementation and optimization
3. No search was used (could have searched for optimization techniques)
4. Provided both standard Python and NumPy implementations with benchmarks

## Key Findings

### 1. **Parallel Execution Works!** üéâ
- 2 out of 3 queries successfully used parallel execution
- The JSON planner correctly identified when both search and code were needed
- Parallel execution reduced latency for complex queries

### 2. **Multi-Tool Usage Improved**
- 2 out of 3 queries used multiple tools
- Average unique tools per query: 2.3
- The planner shows better judgment about when to use tools

### 3. **Tool Selection Patterns**
- **Current Events + Calculation**: Correctly triggered parallel search + code
- **Research + Verification**: Correctly triggered parallel search + code
- **Pure Coding Task**: Correctly identified as code-only

### 4. **Performance Metrics**
- Average response time: 40.9 seconds
- Total tokens used: 43,524
- Successful parallel executions: 66.7%

## Comparison with Previous Testing

### Before Improvements:
- Only 8.3% of queries used E2B/code execution
- No parallel execution capability
- Sequential pattern only (search ‚Üí reason ‚Üí synthesize)
- GPQA questions used reasoning only

### After Improvements:
- 100% of applicable queries used code execution
- 66.7% used parallel execution
- Strategic tool selection based on query type
- Multiple search rounds when needed

## Recommendations

### What's Working Well:
1. **JSON-based planning** successfully identifies multi-tool needs
2. **Parallel execution** reduces latency for complex queries
3. **Code execution** is now used appropriately for calculations
4. **Multiple search rounds** gather comprehensive information

### Areas for Further Improvement:
1. **Search for coding queries**: Even pure coding tasks could benefit from searching for best practices or optimization techniques
2. **Confidence thresholds**: Consider adjusting when to stop iterations
3. **Tool combination strategies**: Explore more sophisticated parallel patterns beyond round-0

## Conclusion

The improvements to the unified agent are working effectively:
- ‚úÖ Parallel execution is functional and being used strategically
- ‚úÖ Multi-tool usage has increased dramatically
- ‚úÖ The JSON planner makes intelligent decisions about tool selection
- ‚úÖ Complex real-world queries are handled more efficiently

The system now demonstrates the intelligent, multi-tool behavior we were aiming for, with strategic use of search and code execution based on query requirements.
