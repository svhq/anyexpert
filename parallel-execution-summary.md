# Parallel Execution Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Planning Prompt (unified-agent.js)
- Changed from rigid `can_parallelize` boolean to flexible `parallel_actions` array
- Model can now suggest any combination of tools to run in parallel
- Works at ANY step, not just the first one

### 2. Modified Execution Logic (unified-agent.js)
- Removed `stepNum === 0` restriction
- Now checks `action.parallelActions` array
- Supports parallel execution of any tool combination

### 3. Key Improvements
- **Model-directed**: The AI decides when parallelization makes sense
- **Flexible**: Can parallelize search+code, multiple searches, etc.
- **Context-aware**: Model considers data dependencies

## Test Results

### With Gemini-2.5-flash-lite
- Partially working - model understands the concept but doesn't always suggest full parallel arrays

### With O4-mini-high
- ✅ Successfully suggests parallel execution
- ✅ Executes multiple tools in parallel
- ✅ Even attempts multiple parallel steps when beneficial

## Example: O4-mini-high Parallel Execution
```
Query: "Calculate the area of a circle with radius 10 meters and search for the current price of Bitcoin"

Step 0: parallel-execution with ["search", "code"]
Step 1: parallel-execution with ["search", "code"] 
```

## Performance Impact
- Reduces sequential overhead between steps
- Model intelligently decides when to parallelize vs. sequential
- No forced parallelization when data dependencies exist

## How It Works
1. Model analyzes query and context
2. Suggests `parallel_actions: ["search", "code"]` when tools can work independently
3. System executes tools in parallel using Promise.all()
4. Results are combined and passed to next step

The implementation is minimal, elegant, and lets the model's intelligence drive the optimization!
