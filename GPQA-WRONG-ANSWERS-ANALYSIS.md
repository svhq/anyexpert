# GPQA Wrong Answers Analysis & Python Library Recommendations (2025)

## Summary of Gemini's Wrong Answers

Gemini-2.5-flash-lite got 3 GPQA questions definitively wrong:

1. **Q1 (Molecular Biology - Morpholino therapy)**: Answered B (polyA tail), correct was D (R-loops)
2. **Q4 (Molecular Biology - ChIP-seq methods)**: Answered A, correct was B  
3. **Q6 (Chemistry - Cassie-Baxter contact angles)**: Answered C (134°), correct was B (124°)

## Detailed Analysis

### Q1: Morpholino Therapy Question

**Why Gemini got it wrong:**
- The question requires deep understanding of RNA splicing mechanisms
- Need to distinguish between structures involved in splicing (antisense, polyA tail, lariat) vs transcription (R-loops)
- R-loops are DNA-RNA hybrids formed during transcription, NOT splicing

**Python Libraries that could help:**
```python
# 2025 Libraries for RNA/Splicing Analysis
1. splicekit - Integrative toolkit for splicing analysis
   - Differential splicing analysis
   - DonJuAn module for junction analysis
   - RNA-protein binding motif identification

2. rnalib (January 2025) - Custom transcriptomics analysis
   - Access to mature (spliced) RNA sequences
   - Automated sequence transformation
   - Integration with pandas DataFrames

3. Biopython - General molecular biology
   - Sequence manipulation
   - File format handling
   - Basic splicing analysis

4. pyrpipe - RNA-Seq workflow automation
   - Pipeline management
   - Quality control
   - Alignment and analysis
```

### Q4: ChIP-seq Methods Question  

**Why Gemini got it wrong:**
- Requires understanding the combination of methods needed
- ChIP-seq + chromosome conformation capture + qRT-PCR gives the most comprehensive view
- Need to understand what each technique measures

**Python Libraries that could help:**
```python
# ChIP-seq Analysis Tools
1. metaseq - Integrative genome-wide analysis
   - Multiple genomic data format support
   - Custom visualization
   - Integration of ChIP-seq with other data types

2. MACS2 - Peak calling
   - Identify protein binding sites
   - Statistical analysis of enrichment

3. DeepTools - Visualization and clustering
   - plotHeatmap for signal intensity
   - Peak clustering analysis
   - Multi-sample comparisons

4. pychipseq - General ChIP-seq pipeline
   - Quality control
   - Alignment
   - Peak calling integration
```

### Q6: Cassie-Baxter Contact Angle Question

**Why Gemini got it wrong:**
- Complex surface chemistry calculation
- Need to apply Cassie-Baxter equation correctly
- Account for roughness factor and surface fraction

**Python Libraries/Approaches:**
```python
# While no dedicated 2025 library exists, implementation approach:

import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def cassie_baxter_angle(theta_smooth, f_solid):
    """
    Calculate Cassie-Baxter contact angle
    cos(theta_CB) = f_solid * cos(theta_smooth) + (1 - f_solid) * cos(180°)
    """
    theta_rad = np.radians(theta_smooth)
    cos_theta_CB = f_solid * np.cos(theta_rad) - (1 - f_solid)
    return np.degrees(np.arccos(cos_theta_CB))

# For the specific problem:
# Water: 132° → 148° (smooth → rough)
# Need to find f_solid first from water data
# Then apply to octane calculation

# General scientific computing libraries:
1. NumPy/SciPy - Mathematical calculations
2. OpenCV - Image analysis for contact angle measurement
3. scikit-image - Advanced image processing
4. pandas - Data management and analysis
```

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Enhanced Library Integration

```python
# Proposed unified approach for GPQA questions

class GPQAEnhancedSolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.bio_tools = {
            'splicing': ['splicekit', 'rnalib', 'biopython'],
            'chip_seq': ['metaseq', 'MACS2', 'deeptools'],
            'structure': ['pymol', 'mdanalysis']
        }
        
        self.chem_tools = {
            'surface': ['numpy', 'scipy', 'matplotlib'],
            'molecules': ['rdkit', 'chempy'],
            'calculations': ['psi4', 'ase']
        }
    
    def analyze_morpholino_question(self, question):
        # Use splicekit for splicing mechanism analysis
        # Use rnalib for RNA structure prediction
        # Cross-reference with known morpholino mechanisms
        pass
    
    def analyze_chip_seq_question(self, question):
        # Use metaseq to understand data integration
        # Reference method combinations
        # Evaluate what each technique measures
        pass
    
    def calculate_contact_angle(self, smooth_angles, target_surface):
        # Implement Cassie-Baxter equation
        # Account for surface heterogeneity
        # Calculate for different liquids
        pass
```

### 2. Domain-Specific Knowledge Enhancement

**For Molecular Biology:**
- Integrate splicing mechanism databases
- Add morpholino therapy knowledge base
- Include ChIP-seq method combinations reference

**For Surface Chemistry:**
- Implement contact angle calculators
- Add wettability transition models
- Include surface tension databases

### 3. Practical Implementation

```python
# Install required libraries (2025 versions)
pip install biopython==1.85 splicekit rnalib
pip install metaseq deeptools
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib

# Example usage for Q6 (Contact Angle)
import numpy as np

def solve_cassie_baxter_problem():
    # Given data
    water_smooth = 132  # degrees
    water_rough = 148   # degrees
    hexadecane_smooth = 102  # degrees
    
    # Calculate solid fraction from water data
    cos_water_smooth = np.cos(np.radians(water_smooth))
    cos_water_rough = np.cos(np.radians(water_rough))
    
    # Cassie-Baxter: cos(θ_rough) = f*cos(θ_smooth) + (1-f)*(-1)
    f_solid = (cos_water_rough + 1) / (cos_water_smooth + 1)
    
    # For octane (similar to hexadecane)
    # Assume similar surface tension ratio
    octane_smooth_estimate = hexadecane_smooth * 0.95  # slight adjustment
    cos_octane_smooth = np.cos(np.radians(octane_smooth_estimate))
    
    # Apply Cassie-Baxter
    cos_octane_rough = f_solid * cos_octane_smooth - (1 - f_solid)
    octane_rough = np.degrees(np.arccos(cos_octane_rough))
    
    return octane_rough  # Should be close to 124°
```

## Conclusion

To improve GPQA performance:

1. **Integrate specialized Python libraries** for each domain
2. **Implement calculation modules** for complex problems
3. **Build knowledge bases** for specific techniques
4. **Use symbolic reasoning** alongside numerical computation
5. **Cross-reference multiple data sources** for validation

The key is combining domain-specific libraries with general scientific computing tools to handle both theoretical understanding and practical calculations.
