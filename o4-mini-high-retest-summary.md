# O4-Mini-High Retest Results Summary

## Overview
Retested the 3 questions that were previously answered incorrectly using the o4-mini-high model instead of google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite.

## Results

### Q4 - History (Hanseatic League) ❌
- **Question**: Which city was NOT a major member of the Hanseatic League?
- **Correct Answer**: J (Stockholm)
- **O4-Mini-High Answer**: E (Amsterdam)
- **Status**: INCORRECT - Same wrong answer as before
- **Response Time**: 50.1 seconds
- **E2B Executions**: 0
- **Analysis**: The model provided detailed historical reasoning and cited sources, but still incorrectly identified Amsterdam as the non-member, when Stockholm was the correct answer.

### Q21 - Math (Composite Functions) ❌
- **Question**: f(x,y) = x² + y² and g(x,y) = x² - y². Find f(g(x,y), g(f(x,y)))
- **Correct Answer**: B (x⁴ + y⁴)
- **O4-Mini-High Answer**: H (x⁴ - 2x²y² + y⁴)
- **Status**: INCORRECT - Different wrong answer than before
- **Response Time**: 116.6 seconds
- **E2B Executions**: 0 (surprisingly, no E2B was used)
- **Analysis**: The model made a different error - it incorrectly interpreted g(f(x,y)) as g(f(x,y), f(x,y)) = 0, when it should be g(x²+y², x²+y²) = (x²+y²)² - (x²+y²)² = 0. However, the final calculation was still wrong.

### Q36 - Health (Polyomaviruses) ❌
- **Question**: Which disease do polyomaviruses predominantly cause?
- **Correct Answer**: C (No disease at all)
- **O4-Mini-High Answer**: A (Tumours)
- **Status**: INCORRECT - Same wrong answer as before
- **Response Time**: 49.6 seconds
- **E2B Executions**: 0
- **Analysis**: The model focused on the etymology of "polyomavirus" (poly + oma = many tumors) and the oncogenic potential in animal models, but missed that in humans they are largely asymptomatic.

## Comparison with Previous Results

| Question | Previous Model Answer | O4-Mini-High Answer | Correct Answer | Change |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------|---------|
| Q4 | E (Amsterdam) | E (Amsterdam) | J (Stockholm) | No change |
| Q21 | D/F (2x⁴ + 2y⁴) | H (x⁴ - 2x²y² + y⁴) | B (x⁴ + y⁴) | Different error |
| Q36 | A (Tumours) | A (Tumours) | C (No disease at all) | No change |

## Key Findings

1. **No Improvements**: The o4-mini-high model did not correct any of the 3 wrong answers.

2. **Response Times**: O4-mini-high was significantly slower:
   - Q4: 50.1s (vs ~10s before)
   - Q21: 116.6s (vs ~20s before)  
   - Q36: 49.6s (vs ~12s before)

3. **E2B Usage**: Surprisingly, o4-mini-high did not trigger E2B for the math question Q21, unlike the previous model.

4. **Error Patterns**:
   - Q4 & Q36: Same reasoning and wrong answers as before
   - Q21: Different mathematical error, still incorrect

## Conclusion

The o4-mini-high model performed worse than expected on these retests:
- 0/3 questions corrected
- Much slower response times
- Different but still incorrect reasoning on Q21

This suggests these particular questions may have inherent ambiguities or require specific domain knowledge that both models lack.
