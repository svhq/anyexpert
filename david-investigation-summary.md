# David Q1 Investigation Summary

## Executive Summary
After deep investigation, I've determined that David's Q1 failures were **not** caused by his specific mortgage calculations, but rather by **concurrent load and resource exhaustion** in the E2B sandbox pool.

## Key Findings

### 1. The Code Works Fine
- David's mortgage calculation code runs successfully 100% of the time in isolation
- All required packages (numpy, etc.) are available in E2B
- The calculations themselves are not problematic

### 2. Root Cause: Concurrent Load + Small Sandbox Pool
When maxWarmSandboxes was set to 1:
- First user (Alice) got the warm sandbox
- Users 2-5 all had to create new sandboxes simultaneously
- E2B's `Sandbox.create()` can fail under heavy concurrent load
- David (user #4) was particularly susceptible because:
  - Sandbox pool was exhausted
  - His code is more complex (takes slightly longer)
  - Multiple retries still failed due to ongoing contention

### 3. The Fix Works
After increasing maxWarmSandboxes from 1 to 10:
- All concurrent tests now pass successfully
- David's code executes reliably even under load
- The larger warm pool prevents resource exhaustion

## Timeline of Events
1. **Initial state**: maxWarmSandboxes = 1
2. **5-user test**: David Q1 consistently failed (4 attempts)
3. **Investigation**: Found it wasn't the code, but resource contention
4. **Fix applied**: maxWarmSandboxes = 10
5. **Retest**: David Q1 now works reliably

## Why David Was "Unlucky"
- Position in queue: User #4 meant pool was likely exhausted
- Code complexity: More complex calculations may have slightly longer initialization
- Timing: Hit E2B during peak contention with other users

## Recommendations
1. **Keep maxWarmSandboxes at 10** - This provides good burst capacity
2. **Monitor E2B metrics** - Track failure rates and sandbox creation times
3. **Consider pre-warming** - Initialize sandboxes during low-usage periods
4. **Add circuit breaker** - Fail fast when E2B is overloaded
5. **Implement request queuing** - Smooth out burst traffic

## Conclusion
David's failures were a symptom of insufficient sandbox pooling, not a problem with his specific queries. The increased warm sandbox pool (10 vs 1) has resolved the issue.
