The problem describes an unknown substance with three key properties: a high melting point, poor electrical conductivity, and insolubility in water. We need to determine the type of bonding most likely present in this substance. Let's systematically analyze how different bonding types align with these properties.

**1. High Melting Point:**
A high melting point indicates that the forces holding the particles (atoms, ions, or molecules) together in the solid state are strong and require a significant amount of thermal energy to overcome. This generally points towards strong interatomic or intermolecular forces, such as strong covalent bonds within a network, strong electrostatic attractions in ionic lattices, or, to a lesser extent, strong hydrogen bonding.

**2. Poor Conductor of Electricity:**
Electrical conductivity in solids requires the presence of mobile charge carriers, typically delocalized electrons (as in metals) or mobile ions (as in molten ionic compounds or electrolytic solutions). A poor conductor implies that charge carriers are either absent or immobile. This generally rules out metallic bonding and ionic bonding in the molten or dissolved state.

**3. Insolubility in Water:**
Water is a polar solvent. The general rule of "like dissolves like" suggests that polar or ionic substances tend to dissolve in polar solvents, while nonpolar substances tend to dissolve in nonpolar solvents. Insolubility in water implies that the interactions between the substance's particles are either too strong to be overcome by solvation with water molecules, or the substance is nonpolar and cannot form favorable interactions with polar water.

Now, let's evaluate each bonding option based on these properties:

*   **(A) Dipole-dipole bonding:** This occurs between polar molecules. While these forces contribute to intermolecular attraction, they are generally weaker than ionic or covalent network bonds, leading to lower melting points. These substances are typically poor conductors and can be soluble in water if the polarity is significant. The high melting point is not characteristic.

*   **(B) Ionic bonding:** Ionic compounds consist of a lattice of positively and negatively charged ions held together by strong electrostatic forces. This results in high melting points and poor electrical conductivity in the *solid state* because the ions are fixed in the lattice. However, ionic compounds often become good conductors when molten or dissolved in water, as the ions become mobile. While many ionic compounds are soluble in water, some are insoluble due to very high lattice energies (e.g., MgO, BaSO₄). The insolubility in water is not a universal characteristic of ionic compounds, making this option less definitively fitting than others might be.

*   **(C) Covalent network bonding:** In covalent network solids, atoms are bonded by a continuous, three-dimensional network of strong covalent bonds. Examples include diamond (C) and silicon dioxide (SiO₂).
    *   **High Melting Point:** Breaking these strong, extensive covalent bonds requires a very large amount of energy, leading to extremely high melting points.
    *   **Poor Conductor:** Electrons are localized in the covalent bonds and are not free to move throughout the structure, resulting in poor electrical conductivity (with exceptions like graphite, which has a different structure).
    *   **Insoluble in Water:** The strong covalent bonds within the network are difficult to break or solvate by water molecules, making these substances generally insoluble in water and most other solvents.
    This option aligns perfectly with all three observed properties.

*   **(D) Nonpolar covalent bonding:** This describes bonding within molecules composed of nonpolar atoms or molecules with symmetrical electron distribution. The forces between such molecules are weak London dispersion forces. These substances typically have low melting points, are poor conductors, and are insoluble in water. The low melting point contradicts the given information.

*   **(E) Coordinate covalent bonding:** This refers to a specific type of covalent bond formation where one atom contributes both electrons. It is a mechanism of bond formation, not a description of the overall bonding structure that determines bulk properties like melting point or conductivity in the same way as the other options. While materials with extensive coordinate covalent bonding might exist, this term alone doesn't fully characterize the bulk properties.

*   **(F) London dispersion bonding:** These are weak intermolecular forces present in all substances but are the primary forces in nonpolar molecules and noble gases. They result in very low melting and boiling points, which contradicts the high melting point.

*   **(G) Van der Waals bonding:** This is a collective term for intermolecular forces, including London dispersion forces and dipole-dipole interactions. Substances held together primarily by these forces generally have low to moderate melting points, not high ones.

*   **(H) Metallic bonding:** Metallic bonding features a lattice of metal cations surrounded by a sea of delocalized electrons. This leads to excellent electrical and thermal conductivity and often high melting points. The poor electrical conductivity directly contradicts this bonding type.

*   **(I) Hydrogen bonding:** This is a strong type of intermolecular force, leading to higher melting points than other intermolecular forces. However, these are still intermolecular forces, generally weaker than ionic or covalent network bonds, and thus result in moderate melting points compared to the "high" described. Many substances with hydrogen bonding are soluble in water.

*   **(J) Polar covalent bonding:** Similar to dipole-dipole bonding, this describes bonding within molecules. The intermolecular forces (dipole-dipole and London dispersion) are typically not strong enough to yield very high melting points.

**Synthesis of Findings:**

The combination of a **high melting point**, **poor electrical conductivity**, and **insolubility in water** is most consistently and strongly indicative of a **covalent network solid**.

*   The high melting point arises from the need to break strong covalent bonds throughout the entire structure.
*   The poor conductivity stems from the localization of electrons within these covalent bonds.
*   The insolubility in water is due to the robust nature of the covalent network, which resists disruption by polar solvent molecules.

While ionic compounds can have high melting points and be poor conductors in the solid state, their solubility in water is often a key characteristic, and some exceptions to insolubility exist. Covalent network solids, on the other hand, inherently exhibit all three properties described.

Therefore, based on the provided research and analysis, the substance most likely contains covalent network bonding.

The final answer is $\boxed{C}$.
