As **Professor Eleanor Vance, a specialist in Criminal Law**, I have thoroughly analyzed the provided scenario under common law principles to determine the most appropriate criminal conviction for the man.

The central issue is whether the man's actions constitute larceny or robbery. To resolve this, we must examine the elements of each crime as defined by common law.

**Common Law Elements of Relevant Crimes:**

*   **Larceny:** At common law, larceny is defined as the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. Key components include:
    *   A "taking" (caption) and carrying away (asportation).
    *   The property must belong to another.
    *   The taking must be trespassory (without consent).
    *   The intent must be to permanently deprive the owner of the property.

*   **Robbery:** Robbery is an aggravated form of larceny. It occurs when larceny is committed by means of force or threat of force against the person of another. The force or threat must be used to accomplish the taking. The essential elements are:
    *   All the elements of larceny.
    *   The taking must be from the person or presence of another.
    *   The taking must be accomplished by force or intimidation.

Let's apply these definitions to the facts of the case:

1.  **The Man's Actions:** The man grabbed the purse from the seat next to the woman, then pushed her out of the way, and fled with the purse. He was apprehended with the stolen property.

2.  **Analysis of the Options:**

    *   **(A) Fraud:** Fraud involves deception, which is not evident in this scenario. The taking was accomplished through physical action.
    *   **(B) Larceny, because he took the purse without the woman's permission:** While the act of taking the purse without permission is larceny, the use of force potentially elevates the crime to robbery.
    *   **(C) Burglary:** Common law burglary requires a breaking and entering of the dwelling house of another at night with the intent to commit a felony therein. A subway car is not a dwelling house, and the timing is not specified as a factor for the crime itself, only for common law burglary.
    *   **(D) Robbery, because he used force in leaving with the purse:** While the force was used during his escape, the critical element for robbery at common law is that the force must be used *in the taking* or to overcome resistance *during* the taking. If the taking were fully complete before the force was applied, it might be larceny followed by assault. However, the sequence of events here is continuous.
    *   **(E) Robbery, because he used force to take possession of the purse:** This option best captures the essence of robbery. The man grabbed the purse from the seat next to the woman (the initial taking), and then immediately pushed her. This push was instrumental in securing his possession of the purse and facilitating his escape with it, all as part of a single, continuous criminal transaction. The force was used to overcome any potential resistance or interference from the victim and to complete the act of taking the purse from her immediate presence.
    *   **(F) Robbery, because he used force to remove the woman from the purse's vicinity:** This is a descriptive statement of the action. The purse was on the seat next to her, placing it within her "presence" for purposes of robbery. The push directly removed her as an obstacle to his acquisition of the purse.
    *   **(G) Larceny, because force was not used until after he took the purse:** This hinges on a strict interpretation of "taking." However, under common law, if force is used immediately following the initial taking to complete the asportation or escape, it is generally considered robbery under the doctrine of continuous transaction. The push was an immediate part of the overall act of taking and carrying away.
    *   **(H) Assault:** While an assault or battery occurred, robbery is a more encompassing charge as it includes the larceny element.
    *   **(I) Larceny, because he made no threat to use force:** This is incorrect, as actual force (pushing) was used, not merely a threat.
    *   **(J) Robbery, because he physically took the purse from the woman's presence:** The purse was on the seat next to her, which is generally considered to be within her "presence" for the purposes of robbery. The key element that distinguishes it from simple larceny is the use of force.

The common law definition of robbery requires that the force be used to accomplish the taking. In this scenario, the act of grabbing the purse and immediately pushing the woman to facilitate his escape with the property constitutes a single, continuous transaction. The force used against the woman was directly linked to and necessary for the completion of the taking and carrying away of the purse from her presence.

Option (E) most accurately reflects this legal principle by stating that the man "used force to take possession of the purse." The push was the means by which he secured and maintained possession of the purse against any potential opposition from the victim, thereby accomplishing the larceny through force.

Therefore, under common law, the man can properly be convicted of robbery.

The final answer is $\boxed{E}$.
