As Dr. Evelyn Reed, a Public Health Epidemiologist specializing in infectious disease eradication, I can confirm that the most effective strategy among the given options for polio eradication, based on the provided research and analysis, is **(E) Attention to sewage control and hygiene**.

My analysis of the provided search results leads to the following conclusions:

*   **Polio Transmission:** Polio is a viral disease transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route [16]. This means that the virus spreads when contaminated feces enter the mouth, often through contaminated water or food, or poor hand hygiene.

*   **Key Eradication Strategies Identified in Research:** The overwhelming consensus in the provided literature points to two primary pillars for polio eradication:
    1.  **High Immunization Coverage:** Multiple sources emphasize the critical role of vaccination in achieving and maintaining high population immunity to prevent transmission [1, 6, 8, 22, 28, 31]. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) relies heavily on vaccines, particularly the Oral Poliovirus Vaccine (OPV) [2, 26].
    2.  **Robust Surveillance:** Effective surveillance systems are essential for detecting poliovirus, monitoring outbreaks, and enabling rapid response [1, 20]. This includes clinical surveillance for symptoms and environmental surveillance, such as wastewater testing [12, 13, 20].

*   **Evaluation of Provided Options:**
    *   **(A) Herbal remedies:** There is no scientific basis or mention in the provided research to suggest that herbal remedies are effective in eradicating polio.
    *   **(B) Use of antibiotics:** Polio is caused by a virus. Antibiotics are effective against bacteria, not viruses, and therefore have no role in eradicating polio [B].
    *   **(C) Regular intake of vitamins:** While good nutrition supports overall health, it is not identified as a direct strategy for polio eradication in the provided materials.
    *   **(D) Administration of tetanus vaccine:** The tetanus vaccine protects against tetanus, a bacterial infection, and is unrelated to polio eradication.
    *   **(E) Attention to sewage control and hygiene:** This aligns directly with strategies to interrupt the fecal-oral transmission of poliovirus. Research indicates that polio spreads in areas with poor access to clean water and handwashing [2]. Improved hygiene and sterility are crucial for preventing diseases transmitted via the fecal-oral route, such as polio [16]. Furthermore, wastewater surveillance is highlighted as a vital public health tool for monitoring poliovirus, underscoring the importance of sanitation [12, 13, 20]. Improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are recognized as key public health interventions [19].
    *   **(F) Natural immunity acquired through exposure:** While exposure can lead to immunity, relying on natural exposure is not an eradication strategy. Eradication requires the complete elimination of the virus from the population, which would not occur through natural exposure and would likely result in significant disease burden.
    *   **(G) Use of antiviral drugs:** While antiviral drugs can play a role in treating viral infections, the primary and proven strategies for eradicating polio, as evidenced by the provided research, are vaccination and preventing transmission through public health measures like improved sanitation and hygiene, coupled with robust surveillance. Antivirals are not presented as the core method for eradication in these findings.

In summary, while vaccination is the cornerstone of polio eradication, improving sanitation and hygiene directly addresses the environmental pathways of polio transmission, making it a critical component of any comprehensive eradication strategy.

The final answer is **(E) Attention to sewage control and hygiene**.
