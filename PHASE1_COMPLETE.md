# Phase 1 Complete: Core Workflow Engine ✅

## What We Built

### 1. **Workflow Engine** (`src/workflow-engine.js`)
- ✅ 3-round search loop with confidence-based stopping
- ✅ Tracks metrics and performance  
- ✅ Integrates all components seamlessly
- ✅ Handles both direct answers and search-augmented responses

### 2. **Query Analyzer** (`src/query-analyzer.js`)
- ✅ LLM-based search necessity detection
- ✅ Fallback heuristics for temporal/current queries
- ✅ Handles non-JSON responses gracefully

### 3. **Search Planner** (`src/search-planner.js`) 
- ✅ Generates diverse search queries
- ✅ Adapts queries based on search round
- ✅ Fallback query generation

### 4. **Web Search** (`src/web-search.js`)
- ✅ Batch search support for parallel queries
- ✅ Serper.dev integration
- ✅ Result formatting and deduplication

### 5. **Information Synthesizer** (`src/information-synthesizer.js`)
- ✅ Direct answer generation
- ✅ Search-augmented response composition
- ✅ Citation formatting

### 6. **Structured Logging** (`src/utils/logger.js`)
- ✅ Pino integration with pretty printing
- ✅ Request tracking with unique IDs
- ✅ Performance metrics logging

## Test Results

```bash
# Direct answer (no search)
node index.js "What is the capital of France?"
✅ Correctly identified as not needing search
✅ Provided immediate answer

# Search-required query  
node index.js "What are the latest AI breakthroughs in 2025?"
✅ Triggered web search
✅ Generated 4 search queries
✅ Retrieved results from Serper
✅ Composed response with citations
✅ Completed in ~13 seconds
```

## Performance Metrics
- **Direct answers**: < 5 seconds
- **Search queries**: ~13 seconds (1 round, 4 queries)
- **Confidence threshold**: Working (stops at 0.9)
- **Serper API calls**: 4 per complex query (within budget)

## Known Issues & Workarounds
1. **JSON parsing**: GLM-4.5-air doesn't reliably return JSON
   - ✅ Implemented fallback parsing logic
   - ✅ Query heuristics for search detection
   
2. **Empty search results**: Some queries return limited results
   - Will be improved with source evaluation in Phase 2

## Ready for Phase 2
The foundation is solid and ready for enhancements:
- Redis caching
- Passage ranking with embeddings  
- Source evaluation
- Improved confidence scoring
