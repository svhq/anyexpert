# MMLU Questions 21-30 Test Results Summary

## Overview
Testing completed on MMLU questions 21-30 with the unified agent and fixed E2B integration. Questions covered Math, Computer Science, Philosophy, Sociology, and History domains.

## Key Findings

### E2B Usage
- **E2B executions detected**: Only in Math questions (Q21, Q22, Q23)
  - Q21: 2 E2B executions
  - Q22: 2 E2B executions 
  - Q23: 1 E2B execution
- **No E2B executions**: Conceptual questions (Q24-Q30)
- E2B was correctly triggered for computational problems

### Performance Metrics
- Average response time: ~15-20 seconds
- Q21 was slowest at 66.2s (complex math with multiple E2B calls)
- Non-computational questions were faster (8-13s)

### Answer Extraction Issues
- Continued regex extraction problems on multiple questions
- Manual verification showed models provided correct answers

- **Model Answer**: A ✓
- **Extraction**: Failed (showed "e"), manual verification confirmed A
- **E2B Executions**: 0
- **Response Time**: 13.1s

### Q25 - Philosophy (Kant's morality principle)
- **Correct Answer**: C (synthetic and a priori)
- **Model Answer**: C ✓
- **Extraction**: Failed (showed "a"), manual verification confirmed C
- **E2B Executions**: 0
- **Response Time**: 26.9s

### Q26 - Philosophy (Aristotle on virtue vs honor)
- **Correct Answer**: A (virtue is superior to honor)
- **Model Answer**: A ✓
- **Extraction**: Failed (showed "h"), manual verification confirmed A
- **E2B Executions**: 0
- **Response Time**: 10.4s

### Q27 - Sociology (Looking-glass self)
- **Correct Answer**: B (self develops through perception of others' evaluations)
- **Model Answer**: B ✓
- **Extraction**: Successful (B)
- **E2B Executions**: 0
- **Response Time**: 8.9s

### Q28 - Sociology (Durkheim's organic solidarity)
- **Correct Answer**: C (interdependence due to specialization)
- **Model Answer**: C ✓
- **Extraction**: Failed (showed "a"), manual verification confirmed C
- **E2B Executions**: 0
- **Response Time**: 10.3s

### Q29 - History (Magna Carta)
- **Correct Answer**: D (limited king's power and established rights)
- **Model Answer**: D ✓
- **Extraction**: Failed (null)
- **E2B Executions**: 0
- **Response Time**: 11.8s

### Q30 - History (Fall of Roman Empire)
- **Correct Answer**: C (combination of factors)
- **Model Answer**: C ✓
- **Extraction**: Failed (showed "b"), manual verification confirmed C
- **E2B Executions**: 0
- **Response Time**: 12.4s

## Success Rate
- **Overall**: 9/10 correct (90%) based on manual verification
- **Q21 incorrect** - model calculation error on composite functions
- **Automatic Extraction**: 1/10 successful (10%) - only Q27
- **Manual Verification Required**: 9/10 (90%)

## E2B Analysis
- Total E2B executions across all tests: 5
- E2B correctly triggered for mathematical/computational problems
- No E2B usage for conceptual questions (as expected)
- E2B execution times: ~1-2 seconds per execution

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Answer Extraction Urgently**:
   - Current regex patterns are failing 90% of the time
   - Consider using the final answer statement directly
   - Add more robust patterns for boxed answers and bold text

2. **Review Math Accuracy**:
   - Q21 showed incorrect calculation despite using E2B
   - May need to improve symbolic math handling

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Q21 took 66.2s - investigate why multiple E2B calls took so long
   - Consider caching or optimizing repeated calculations

## Conclusion
The unified agent demonstrated strong performance on 9/10 questions, with E2B correctly activating for computational problems. The main technical debt is the answer extraction system, which needs significant improvement. The one incorrect answer (Q21) suggests room for improvement in complex mathematical reasoning.
