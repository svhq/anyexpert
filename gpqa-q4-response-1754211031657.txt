As **Dr. Evelyn Reed, a Molecular Geneticist specializing in gene regulation**, I've thoroughly reviewed the research objectives and the provided methodological options. The core of this investigation is to understand how a mutation in the *HOXB2* gene impacts the relationship between chromatin structure and gene expression in patient cells compared to healthy controls.

To effectively explore this relationship, we need a suite of tools that can:
1.  **Assess Chromatin Structure and Regulatory Protein Binding:** This involves examining epigenetic modifications and the occupancy of regulatory proteins at specific genomic loci.
2.  **Quantify Gene Expression:** This requires measuring the levels of RNA transcripts to identify genes that are up- or down-regulated.
3.  **Validate Key Findings:** Specific gene expression changes identified by global methods need to be confirmed with a more targeted approach.

Let's evaluate each option against these requirements:

*   **A) ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and qRT PCR:**
    *   **ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing):** This technique is excellent for mapping the genomic locations of specific histone modifications or transcription factor binding sites [1]. By performing ChIP-seq for relevant factors (e.g., those known to interact with HOXB2 or chromatin remodelers), we can directly investigate how the *HOXB2* mutation alters the epigenetic landscape and the binding of regulatory proteins. This directly addresses the "chromatin structure" aspect.
    *   **RNA-seq (RNA Sequencing):** This method provides a comprehensive snapshot of the transcriptome, allowing us to quantify the expression levels of all genes in a cell [2]. Comparing RNA-seq data from patient cells to healthy controls will reveal global changes in gene expression that may be a consequence of the *HOXB2* mutation and associated chromatin alterations. This directly addresses the "gene expression" aspect.
    *   **qRT-PCR (Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction):** While RNA-seq offers a broad view, qRT-PCR is a highly sensitive and specific method for validating and quantifying the expression of individual genes [3]. It is crucial for confirming the most significant findings from RNA-seq, especially for genes like *HOXB2* itself or its downstream targets. This fulfills the "validate key findings" requirement.

*   **B) ChIP-seq, chromosome conformation capture, and qRT-PCR:**
    *   This option includes ChIP-seq and qRT-PCR, which are valuable. Chromosome conformation capture (CCC) techniques (like Hi-C or 3C) are excellent for studying the three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome and identifying long-range regulatory interactions [4]. While 3D organization is a component of chromatin structure, it doesn't directly measure the specific epigenetic marks or protein binding events that ChIP-seq does. Crucially, this combination *lacks a direct measure of global gene expression* (RNA-seq), making it difficult to establish the functional consequences of the chromatin alterations.

*   **C) ChIP-seq and RNA-seq:**
    *   This combination directly addresses both the chromatin structure (via ChIP-seq) and gene expression (via RNA-seq). It provides a strong foundation for correlative analysis. However, it omits the critical validation step provided by qRT-PCR, which is often necessary to confirm the most relevant gene expression changes, particularly in a disease context.

*   **D) Chromosome conformation capture and RNA-seq:**
    *   This option includes RNA-seq for gene expression. Chromosome conformation capture addresses genome organization, a facet of chromatin structure. However, it *misses the direct assessment of protein binding and specific epigenetic marks* that ChIP-seq provides, which are more direct indicators of regulatory activity.

**Conclusion:**

To comprehensively investigate the relationship between chromatin structure and gene expression, a multi-faceted approach is required. Option A, comprising **ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and qRT-PCR**, offers the most complete and robust experimental design. ChIP-seq will reveal how the *HOXB2* mutation affects the epigenetic landscape and regulatory protein binding. RNA-seq will quantify the resulting changes in gene expression across the entire transcriptome. Finally, qRT-PCR will serve to validate the most significant gene expression alterations. This combination allows for a direct correlation between observed changes in chromatin structure and their functional impact on gene expression, providing the most insightful data for understanding the disease mechanism.

The final answer is $\boxed{A}$.
