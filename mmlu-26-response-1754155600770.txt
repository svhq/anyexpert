My analysis of Aristotle's ethical framework, primarily as presented in the *Nicomachean Ethics*, leads me to conclude that he considers **virtue to be superior to honor**.

Aristotle identifies *eudaimonia* (flourishing or the good life) as the ultimate human good. He posits that *eudaimonia* is achieved through the cultivation of virtues (*aretē*), which are excellent character traits that enable individuals to perform their unique human function—rational activity—excellently. These virtues are internal dispositions, developed through habit and practice, and are fundamental to a well-lived life.

Honor (*timē*), while often pursued by virtuous individuals, is viewed by Aristotle as an external reward and a form of social recognition. He notes in the *Nicomachean Ethics* (Book I, Chapter 5) that people seek honor "that they may be assured of their own merit; and they seek it also that they may have confidence in their own virtue" [1]. This suggests that honor is often a consequence or validation of virtue, rather than virtue itself.

Crucially, Aristotle expresses reservations about honor being the highest good. He argues that honor is too superficial and dependent on external validation: "For honor seems to depend more on those who confer it than on those who receive it" [1]. Because honor is externally bestowed and subject to the opinions of others, it is less stable and less intrinsically valuable than virtue, which resides within the individual.

Therefore, while honor may be a desirable outcome associated with virtuous action, it is not the ultimate goal, nor is it equivalent to virtue. Virtue is the internal disposition that directly contributes to human flourishing, making it fundamentally more important and superior in Aristotle's ethical hierarchy.

Based on this, the option that best reflects Aristotle's position is:

(A) virtue is superior to honor.

The final answer is $\boxed{A}$.
