The question asks about the *first accurate* measurement of Pluto's diameter. My analysis of the provided research indicates that the most significant advancement leading to the first accurate and direct determination of Pluto's diameter came from observations of the mutual eclipses and occultations between Pluto and its moon, Charon.

Several sources highlight this breakthrough:

*   Findings [1] and [34] explicitly state: "For the first time, an accurate and direct determination of the diameters of the outermost planet Pluto and its moon, Charon, has been made. On the basis of measurements of light changes during eclipses, Pluto was found to have a diameter of 2200Â±140 km."
*   Furthermore, findings [2] and [19] reiterate that "Observations of Pluto in occultation with Charon allowed scientists to establish Pluto's diameter more accurately."
*   Finding [27] also supports this by mentioning that "careful and precise measurements of the mutual eclipses and occultations of the Pluto-Charon system has produced determinations of the sizes..."

This method, utilizing the interactions between Pluto and Charon, provided a significant leap in accuracy compared to earlier estimates. For context, Gerard Kuiper's 1950 measurement, made using a star occultation with a ground-based telescope (like the 200-inch telescope mentioned in [5, 7, 11]), yielded an estimate of approximately 6,000 km, which was later found to be inaccurate. The discovery of Charon in 1978 [8] was crucial for enabling the more precise measurements through mutual events.

Now, let's evaluate the provided options against this understanding:

*   **(A) Lunar-based observations made during NASA:** There is no information in the provided results to suggest that accurate measurements of Pluto's diameter were first made using lunar-based observations.
*   **(F) s telescope observations of Pluto:** This option is incomplete. If it refers to early ground-based telescope observations (like Kuiper's), these were not the *first accurate* measurements.
*   **(G) radar observations made by the Arecibo telescope:** While radar observations are powerful for planetary measurements [20, 37], the provided texts do not attribute the *first accurate* diameter determination of Pluto to Arecibo radar. Radar contributed to distance measurements that could improve diameter estimates, but the direct diameter determination was linked to occultations.
*   **(H) Observations made by the Spitzer Space Telescope:** Spitzer is an infrared telescope, and while it advanced astronomical capabilities [17, 18], the findings do not indicate it was responsible for the *first accurate* diameter measurement of Pluto.
*   **(I) Hubble Space Telescope images that resolved Pluto:** The Hubble Space Telescope provided improved observations [18] and contributed to our understanding, but the primary breakthrough for the *first accurate* determination is consistently linked to the Pluto-Charon mutual events, which predate the most detailed Hubble analyses for this specific purpose.

**Conclusion:**

The analysis of the provided research clearly indicates that the first accurate determination of Pluto's diameter was achieved through observations of the mutual eclipses and occultations involving Pluto and its moon, Charon.

**Since none of the provided options directly describe this method ("observations of mutual eclipses and occultations between Pluto and Charon"), I cannot definitively select an option from the list as presented.** The question is based on incomplete options relative to the supporting evidence. The accurate measurement was enabled by studying the Pluto-Charon system's interactions.
