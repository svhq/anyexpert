# MMLU Questions 11-20 Test Results Summary

## Overview
Testing completed on MMLU questions 11-20 using the unified agent with fixed E2B integration. All tests were run individually with full response capture and manual answer extraction when needed.

## Key Findings

### E2B Usage
- **0 E2B executions** across all 10 questions (Q11-Q20)
- This is expected as these were conceptual questions in medicine, psychology, and biology
- E2B integration is working (confirmed with separate test) but wasn't triggered by these questions

### Performance Metrics
- Average response time: ~20-25 seconds per question
- Consistent tool usage pattern: typically `reason, reason, synthesize`
- Token usage: 5,000-8,000 tokens per question

### Answer Extraction Issues
- Regex extraction had issues with several questions (Q17, Q18, Q19)
- Often extracted single letters like "i" or "e" instead of the correct answer
- Manual verification of saved response files showed the models provided correct answers
- The issue is with our regex patterns, not the model responses

- **Response Time**: 23.1s
- **Notes**: 11 mentions of "Metformin" in response

### Q18 - Medicine (Mitochondrial increase)
- **Correct Answer**: B (Increased synthesis of oxidative enzymes)
- **Model Answer**: B ✓
- **Extraction**: Failed (showed "i"), manual verification confirmed B
- **Response Time**: 21.3s
- **Notes**: Response clearly stated "(B) Increased synthesis of oxidative enzymes"

### Q19 - Biology (Calcium regulation)
- **Correct Answer**: D (Parathyroid hormone)
- **Model Answer**: D ✓
- **Extraction**: Failed (showed "e"), manual verification confirmed D
- **Response Time**: 21.7s
- **Notes**: Response clearly stated "(D) Parathyroid hormone"

### Q20 - Biology (Genetic variation sources)
- **Correct Answer**: B (Binary fission)
- **Model Answer**: B ✓
- **Extraction**: Successful (extracted "b")
- **Response Time**: 22.4s

## Success Rate
- **Overall**: 10/10 correct (100%) based on manual verification
- **Automatic Extraction**: 7/10 successful (70%)
- **Manual Verification Required**: 3/10 (30%)

## Recommendations

1. **Improve Answer Extraction**:
   - Update regex patterns to better handle various answer formats
   - Consider implementing a more robust NLP-based answer extraction
   - Add fallback patterns for edge cases

2. **E2B Integration**:
   - Consider testing with more computational questions (physics, chemistry, math)
   - Add explicit prompts that might trigger code execution

3. **Response Time Optimization**:
   - Current 20-25s response times are acceptable
   - Could potentially optimize by reducing reasoning steps for simpler questions

## Conclusion
The unified agent successfully answered all 10 MMLU questions correctly, demonstrating strong performance on conceptual questions across medicine, psychology, and biology domains. The main technical issue is with answer extraction regex patterns, not the model's ability to reason about the questions.
