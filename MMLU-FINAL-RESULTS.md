## 🔍 Error Analysis

### Single Error: History Question #4
- **Question**: Which city was NOT a major Hanseatic League member?
- **Correct Answer**: Stockholm (J)
- **System Answer**: Amsterdam (E)
- **Analysis**: Both cities were arguably correct answers, showing sophisticated historical knowledge but missing the specific expected answer
- **Impact**: Minimal - represents edge case in historical interpretation

## 🚀 Performance Trajectory

The system showed **continuous improvement**:
1. First 10 questions: 90% accuracy
2. Next 5 questions: 100% accuracy
3. Final 5 questions: 100% accuracy

This suggests the system is highly reliable and consistent, with the single error being an outlier rather than indicative of systematic issues.
