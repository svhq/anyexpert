# GPQA Q11-Q20 Testing Results with Improved Agent

## Test Date: 2025-08-03

### Summary
- **Completed**: 3 questions (Q11, Q12, Q13)
- **Timeout**: During Q14 after 10 minutes
- **Correct**: 1 out of 3 (33.3%)

### Detailed Results

#### Q11 - Molecular Biology ❌
- **Expected**: C (CHIP-seq, chromosome conformation capture, and qRT-PCR)
- **Got**: Unable to extract answer
- **Duration**: 51.3s
- **Tools Used**: reason → reason → reason → reason → reason → synthesize
- **Issue**: Only used reasoning, no search or code execution

#### Q12 - Chemistry (general) ✅
- **Expected**: A (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3)
- **Got**: A
- **Duration**: 242.5s (4 minutes)
- **Tools Used**: code → code → code → code → code → code → code → code → code → code → synthesize
- **Success**: Used code execution 10 times to calculate pH and volume

#### Q13 - Quantum Mechanics ❌
- **Expected**: A (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))
- **Got**: Unable to extract answer (but calculation was correct)
- **Duration**: 81.3s
- **Tools Used**: code → code → code → code → code → code
- **Issue**: The model correctly calculated the answer as A but didn't format it properly for extraction

#### Q14 - Quantum Mechanics (Incomplete)
- **Expected**: D
- **Status**: Test timed out during execution
- **Tools Started**: code execution was being used

### Tool Usage Analysis

1. **Code Execution Usage**: 
   - Q11: 0% (should have searched for methods)
   - Q12: 100% (correctly used for calculations)
   - Q13: 100% (correctly used for quantum calculations)

2. **Search Usage**: 0% across all questions

3. **Parallel Execution**: 0% (none triggered)

### Key Findings

1. **Improvements Working Partially**:
   - Code execution is now being used for calculation-heavy questions
   - Q12 shows the system can handle complex chemistry calculations
   - Q13 shows correct computation but formatting issues

2. **Remaining Issues**:
   - No search usage even for specialized topics (Q11 molecular biology)
   - Answer extraction still problematic (Q11, Q13)
   - Long execution times (Q12 took 4 minutes)
   - No parallel execution triggered

3. **Positive Outcomes**:
   - The JSON planner correctly identifies calculation needs
   - Code execution works reliably when triggered
   - Complex multi-step calculations are handled well

### Recommendations

1. **Adjust Planning Logic**: The planner should trigger search for specialized scientific terms
2. **Fix Answer Extraction**: Need better regex patterns or explicit prompting
3. **Optimize Execution**: Q12's 10 code executions could be consolidated
4. **Continue Testing**: Need to complete Q14-Q20 to get full picture

### Next Steps
- Fix timeout issues and complete remaining questions
- Analyze why search isn't being triggered for domain-specific questions
- Improve answer extraction patterns
