As **Dr. Evelyn Reed, Senior Economist specializing in National Accounts**, I have reviewed the provided analysis and can confirm its accuracy based on standard methodologies for calculating Gross Domestic Product (GDP) using the expenditure approach.

The expenditure approach to GDP sums spending on final goods and services in an economy. The components are typically:
*   **Consumption (C):** Spending by households on goods and services.
*   **Investment (I):** Spending by businesses on capital goods (machinery, equipment, buildings), changes in inventories, and spending by households on new housing.
*   **Government Spending (G):** Spending by government entities on goods and services.
*   **Net Exports (NX):** Exports minus imports.

Let's re-evaluate each option through this lens to identify which falls under **Consumption (C)**:

*   **(A) The purchase of a new car by a car rental company:** This is an acquisition of a capital good by a business for productive use. It is classified as **Investment (I)**.
*   **(B) The purchase of a new construction crane by a construction company:** Similar to (A), this is business investment in machinery, a capital good. It is classified as **Investment (I)**.
*   **(C) A company buying a new office building:** The purchase of non-residential structures by businesses is a component of business fixed **Investment (I)**.
*   **(D) A homeowner mowing her own lawn:** This activity is not a market transaction and therefore is **excluded from GDP**.
*   **(E) Flour purchased by a baker to make donuts:** Flour is an **intermediate good**. Its value is incorporated into the final product (donuts) and is not directly counted in GDP to avoid double-counting. The sale of the donuts to consumers would be Consumption (C).
*   **(F) The purchase of new computer software by an accounting firm:** In modern national accounts, business spending on software that provides future economic benefits is treated as an **Investment (I)**, specifically as an intangible asset.
*   **(G) $50.00 spent eating out at a restaurant:** This represents spending by a household on a service (dining) and a final good (the meal). This is a clear example of household consumption and is classified under **Consumption (C)**.
*   **(H) A barber cutting his own hair:** This is a non-market activity, similar to (D), and is **excluded from GDP**.

Therefore, based on the expenditure approach to GDP, only option (G) represents spending by households on final goods and services.

The final answer is:
**(G) $50.00 spent eating out at a restaurant**
