As Dr. Evelyn Reed, a Spectroscopy and Quantum Optics Specialist, I can help you understand the relationship between quantum state lifetimes and energy resolution.

The ability to distinguish between two quantum states is fundamentally limited by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, specifically its time-energy formulation. This principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy ($\Delta E$) and the uncertainty in time ($\Delta t$) for a given quantum state is bounded by a constant:

$\Delta E \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$

where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. The lifetime of a quantum state, often denoted by $\tau$, is directly related to the uncertainty in its energy. A shorter lifetime implies a larger uncertainty in energy, and consequently, a broader spectral line. Conversely, a longer lifetime implies a smaller energy uncertainty and a narrower spectral line.

To clearly resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be significantly larger than the inherent energy uncertainty of each state. A common rule of thumb in spectroscopy is that the energy difference between two levels should be at least an order of magnitude greater than the energy width (uncertainty) of the narrower spectral line, which is determined by the shorter lifetime.

The energy uncertainty ($\Delta E$) can be estimated from the lifetime ($\tau$) using the relation:

$\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}$

The reduced Planck constant, $\hbar$, is approximately $1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot\text{s}$.

Let's calculate the energy uncertainty for each of the given lifetimes:

**For the state with a lifetime $\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ sec:**

$\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot\text{s}}{10^{-9} \text{ s}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \text{ J}$

To convert this energy to electron volts (eV), we use the conversion factor $1 \text{ eV} \approx 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$:

$\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \text{ J}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}} \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$

**For the state with a lifetime $\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ sec:**

$\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot\text{s}}{10^{-8} \text{ s}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \text{ J}$

Converting to eV:

$\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \text{ J}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}} \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \text{ eV}$

To clearly resolve these two levels, their energy difference must be greater than the energy width of the *narrower* spectral line, which is associated with the *longer* lifetime. However, to ensure clear distinction and overcome the broadening effects from both states, it is prudent to consider the energy uncertainty associated with the *shorter* lifetime. This is because the shorter lifetime contributes more significantly to the spectral broadening, making it the limiting factor for resolution. Therefore, the minimum energy difference required for clear resolution should be on the order of or greater than $\Delta E_1$.

The threshold for clear resolution is approximately $\Delta E_1 \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$.

Now let's compare this threshold with the given options:

*   **A) $10^{-9} \text{ eV}$**: This is much smaller than $6.582 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$.
*   **B) $10^{-8} \text{ eV}$**: This is also much smaller than $6.582 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$.
*   **C) $10^{-11} \text{ eV}$**: This is significantly smaller than $6.582 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$.
*   **D) $10^{-4} \text{ eV}$**: This is much larger than $6.582 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$.

Therefore, an energy difference of $10^{-4} \text{ eV}$ would be sufficient to clearly resolve these two quantum states, as it is substantially larger than the energy uncertainty dictated by the shorter lifetime [12, 30].

The final answer is **D) 10^-4 eV**.
