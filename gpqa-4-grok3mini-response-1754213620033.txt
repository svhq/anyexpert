As Dr. Elena Vasquez, Professor of Genomic Epigenetics and Gene Regulation at a leading research institution, I continue my analysis of your query on investigating the HOXB2 mutation's impact on chromatin structure and gene expression. Drawing from over 20 years of expertise in functional genomics, including integrating high-throughput techniques like ChIP-seq and chromosome conformation capture, I'll provide a concise yet comprehensive conclusion based on the step-by-step reasoning outlined earlier. This ensures we address the biological question with scientific rigor, leveraging evidence from the provided web search results and established literature.

To recap briefly: Your investigation requires a multifaceted approach to link the HOXB2 mutation to changes in chromatin architecture and gene expression. This involves assessing epigenetic modifications, 3D chromatin organization, and gene expression levels with validation. After evaluating the options against these criteria, Option B emerges as the most effective due to its comprehensive coverage.

### Final Recommendation
Based on the analysis, the optimal combination of methods is **Option B: ChIP-seq, chromosome conformation capture, and qRT-PCR**. This selection provides:
- **ChIP-seq** for detailed mapping of epigenetic marks (e.g., histone modifications near HOXB2), as supported by studies on protein-DNA interactions ([1], [2], [11], [13], [42]).
- **Chromosome conformation capture** to reveal 3D chromatin interactions, such as potential disruptions in enhancer-promoter looping caused by the mutation, which is crucial for understanding spatial gene regulation ([15], [16], [21], [23], [38]).
- **qRT-PCR** for targeted validation of gene expression changes, ensuring the reliability of broader findings and allowing precise confirmation of HOXB2-related transcripts ([20], [33], [44]).

This combination aligns with best practices in epigenomics, offering a holistic view that avoids the limitations of the other options—such as the absence of 3D analysis in Option A or the lack of epigenetic detail in Option D. By integrating these methods, you can robustly correlate chromatin alterations with expression differences between patient and healthy cells, providing strong evidence for the mutation's role in the disease.

For practical implementation, I recommend using at least three biological replicates per condition to achieve statistical significance, and analyzing data with tools like HiC-Pro for conformation capture or DESeq2 for differential expression validation. If you need assistance with experimental design or data analysis scripts, I can guide you further.
