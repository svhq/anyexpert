      "explanation": "According to the uncertainty principle, Delta E* Delta t=hbar/2. Delta t is the lifetime and Delta E is the width of the energy level. With Delta t=10^-9 s==> Delta E1= 3.3 10^-7 ev. And Delta t=10^-11 s gives Delta E2=3.310^-8 eV. Therefore, the energy difference between the two states must be significantly greater than 10^-7 ev. So the answer is 10^-4 ev."

    "answer": "As Professor Anya Sharma, a specialist in Quantum Mechanics and Spectroscopy, I can help you determine the energy difference required to resolve these two quantum states.\n\nThe ability to resolve two energy levels is fundamentally linked to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation:\n\n$\\Delta E \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\Delta E$ is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   $\\Delta t$ is the uncertainty in time, which in this context relates to the lifetime of the state.\n*   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant ($h \\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$).\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" their energy difference ($\\Delta E$) must be significantly larger than the uncertainty in their energy ($\\Delta E_{uncertainty}$). A common criterion for clear resolution is that the energy difference should be at least on the order of the uncertainty in energy. Therefore, we can use the relation:\n\n$\\Delta E \\approx \\Delta E_{uncertainty}$\n\nAnd from the uncertainty principle, the minimum energy difference for resolution is related to the lifetime of the states. Since we have two states with different lifetimes, we should consider the lifetime that imposes the stricter condition for resolution. The shorter the lifetime, the larger the minimum energy difference required for resolution.\n\nLet's calculate the minimum energy difference for each state:\n\n**State 1:**\nLifetime $\\Delta t_1 = 10^{-9}$ sec\nEnergy $E_1$\n\n**State 2:**\nLifetime $\\Delta t_2 = 10^{-8}$ sec\nEnergy $E_2$\n\nWe need to find the energy difference $\\Delta E = |E_1 - E_2|$. The minimum energy difference required to resolve these states is dictated by the shorter lifetime, which is $\\Delta t_1 = 10^{-9}$ sec.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of $\\hbar$ in units of eV$\\cdot$s.\nPlanck's constant $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$.\nTo convert Joules to electron-volts (eV), we use the conversion factor $1 \\text{ eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$.\nSo, $1 \\text{ J} = \\frac{1}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n$\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi} = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}}{2\\pi}$\n\nNow, let's convert $\\hbar$ to eV$\\cdot$s:\n$\\hbar (\\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{s}) = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}}{2\\pi \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV}}$\n\nThe minimum energy difference for resolution is approximately:\n$\\Delta E_{min} \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta t}$\n\nWe will use the shorter lifetime, $\\Delta t_1 = 10^{-9}$ sec.\n\nLet's perform the calculation using Python.\n\n**Calculation:**\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nh = 6.626e-34  # Planck's constant in J.s\nhbar = h / (2 * np.pi) # Reduced Planck constant in J.s\neV_to_J = 1.602e-19 # Conversion factor from eV to J\n\n# Lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9  # Lifetime of state 1 in seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # Lifetime of state 2 in seconds\n\n# We need to resolve the states, so the energy difference must be at least\n# on the order of the uncertainty in energy, which is related to the lifetime.\n# The stricter condition comes from the shorter lifetime.\ndelta_t_min = tau1\n\n# Calculate the minimum energy uncertainty in Joules\ndelta_E_uncertainty_J = hbar / delta_t_min\n\n# Convert the minimum energy uncertainty to eV\ndelta_E_uncertainty_eV = delta_E_uncertainty_J / eV_to_J\n\nprint(f\"Reduced Planck constant (hbar) in J.s: {hbar:.3e} J.s\")\nprint(f\"Minimum energy uncertainty for state 1 (delta E) in J: {delta_E_uncertainty_J:.3e} J\")\nprint(f\"Minimum energy uncertainty for state 1 (delta E) in eV: {delta_E_uncertainty_eV:.3e} eV\")\n\n# The energy difference must be at least this value for clear resolution.\n# We are looking for an energy difference that is on this order or larger.\n```\n\n**Result:**\n```\nReduced Planck constant (hbar) in J.s: 1.055e-34 J.s\nMinimum energy uncertainty for state 1 (delta E) in J: 1.055e-25 J\nMinimum energy uncertainty for state 1 (delta E) in eV: 6.583e-07 eV\n```",
