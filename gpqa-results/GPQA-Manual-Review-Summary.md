## Analysis by Category (After Manual Review)
- **Molecular Biology**: 1/2 (50%)
- **Physics**: 1/1 (100%)
- **Organic Chemistry**: 0/2 (0%)
- **Quantum Mechanics**: 1/1 (100%)
- **Chemistry (general)**: 0/1 (0%)
- **Genetics**: 1/2 (50%)
- **Electromagnetism**: 0/1 (0%)

## Key Observations

1. **Actual Performance**: After manual review, the system got 3/10 correct (30%), better than the automated extraction suggested (2/10).

2. **Answer Format Issues**: The automated extraction missed several answers because they were embedded in the reasoning or used different formats:
   - Q2: Answer was implied from calculation
   - Q4: Used "$\boxed{A}$" format
   - Q5: Used "$\boxed{-0.7}$" format
   - Q8: Used "The final answer is **(A)**" format

3. **Physics/Math Strong**: The system performed well on physics and quantum mechanics questions (2/2 = 100%)

4. **Chemistry Weak**: Chemistry questions performed poorly (0/3 = 0%), suggesting issues with:
   - Carbon counting in synthesis
   - Physical chemistry calculations
   - Stereochemistry determination

5. **Biology Mixed**: Molecular biology and genetics had mixed results (2/4 = 50%)

## Recommendations

1. **Standardize Answer Format**: Enforce a consistent final answer format like "Final Answer: (X)"
2. **Improve Chemistry Reasoning**: Despite having RDKit libraries, the model needs better chemical reasoning capabilities
3. **Reduce Response Length**: Q9's 149K character response suggests the need for conciseness constraints
4. **Better Answer Extraction**: Implement more robust answer extraction that can handle various formats
