      "explanation": "The experimental conditions and output are simplified. Looking at the data, we must reply to three questions: - Which gene(s) is a transcription factor? - Are there signs of gene redundancy or pleiotropy? - Is any of the genes epistatic towards (an)other one(s)? We can identify a transcription factor upstream of other genes by a decrease in resistance after its knock-out. In single mutants, we can see that knockout of G2 drastically decreases the resistance, while knockout of the other two genes reduces the resistance much less. This allows us to suggest that G2 controls the expression of two other genes, as its knockout leads to the loss of their functionality. Looking at the single-mutant data of G1 and G3, we can see that both genes contribute to the resistance if G2 is active – therefore, they are examples of gene redundancy. We see that G1 alone (with knockout G3) contributes to half of the total resistance (50%). We would expect that G3 would contribute another 50% if G1 is knockout, but it contributes 75%, which suggests that G1 has epistatic interactions towards G3 and decreases its expression when active. Therefore, the correct answer: G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. G1 is epistatic towards G3."

    "answer": "As Dr. Evelyn Reed, a plant molecular geneticist specializing in disease resistance, I can analyze these experimental results to elucidate the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3 in white lupine's resistance to anthracnose.\n\nThe experiment involves single and double knock-out mutants to understand the genetic basis of resistance. The provided resistance percentages represent the relative ability of the mutant plants to withstand the fungal pathogen compared to the wild-type (control). A lower percentage indicates reduced resistance, meaning increased sensitivity to the disease.\n\nLet's denote the wild-type resistance as R_WT. The observed resistance levels are:\n- R(g1) = 0.75 * R_WT\n- R(g2) = 0 * R_WT\n- R(g3) = 0.50 * R_WT\n- R(g1g3) = 0.10 * R_WT\n- R(g2g3) = 0 * R_WT\n- R(g1g2) = 0 * R_WT\n\nWe are told that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of other genes. This implies a hierarchical regulatory relationship. Epistasis describes a situation where one gene masks or modifies the phenotypic effect of another gene. Gene redundancy means that multiple genes perform similar functions, so knocking out one has little effect if another is functional. Pleiotropy occurs when a single gene influences multiple distinct traits.\n\nLet's analyze the data systematically:\n\n1.  **Identify the most severe phenotype:** The `g2` mutant shows complete loss of resistance (0%). This suggests that G2 plays a critical role in resistance, potentially as a central regulator or a component whose absence is catastrophic for resistance. The double mutants involving `g2` (`g1g2`, `g2g3`) also show complete loss of resistance. This is a strong indicator that G2 is essential and its absence overrides the effects of other mutations.\n\n2.  **Analyze the double mutants involving G2:**\n    *   `g1g2` resistance is 0%. This means the absence of G2 completely abolishes resistance, regardless of the state of G1.\n    *   `g2g3` resistance is 0%. Similarly, the absence of G2 completely abolishes resistance, regardless of the state of G3.\n    *   These results strongly suggest that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, or that G2 is a master regulator whose absence leads to a complete loss of function for resistance. If G2 is a transcription factor, its absence would prevent the expression of downstream genes required for resistance.\n\n3.  **Analyze the `g1g3` double mutant:**\n    *   `g1g3` resistance is 10%. This is significantly lower than the single mutants `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%). This suggests that both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, and their combined absence has a more severe effect than the absence of either alone. This could indicate gene redundancy or a synergistic interaction.\n\n4.  **Consider the role of G2 as a Transcription Factor:** If G2 is a TF, its absence would lead to a loss of downstream gene expression. The complete loss of resistance in `g2` mutants supports this.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the relationship between G1 and G3:**\n    *   `g1` resistance is 75%.\n    *   `g3` resistance is 50%.\n    *   `g1g3` resistance is 10%.\n    The combined effect of losing both G1 and G3 is much more severe than losing either one individually. This implies that G1 and G3 might be involved in parallel pathways or have partially overlapping functions that contribute to resistance.\n\n    *   **If G1 is epistatic to G3:** This would mean that the phenotype of `g1` (75% resistance) masks the phenotype of `g3`. However, the `g1g3` double mutant has only 10% resistance, which is much lower than the `g1` single mutant. This contradicts G1 being epistatic to G3 in a simple masking sense. Epistasis usually implies that the epistatic gene's mutation phenotype is observed when both genes are mutated. Here, the double mutant phenotype is distinct and more severe.\n\n    *   **If G3 is epistatic to G1:** This would mean the phenotype of `g3` (50% resistance) is observed when both are mutated. Again, the `g1g3` double mutant has 10% resistance, which is not the phenotype of `g3`.\n\n    *   **Gene Redundancy:** If G1 and G3 have redundant functions, knocking out one would reduce resistance, and knocking out both would lead to a more significant reduction. The data (75% for g1, 50% for g3, 10% for g1g3) is consistent with this. The combined loss of function leads to a much lower resistance level.\n\n    *   **Pleiotropy:** Pleiotropy means a single gene affects multiple traits. While possible, the primary interaction we are trying to decipher here is the functional relationship between G1, G2, and G3 in the context of anthracnose resistance. The observed phenotypes in single and double mutants are more directly indicative of epistatic or redundant relationships within this specific pathway.\n\n6.  **Re-evaluating Epistasis:** Let's consider the possibility that G2 is the TF. If G2 is a TF, it might regulate G1 and/or G3, or genes downstream of them.\n    *   If G2 is a TF, and its absence leads to 0% resistance, it's a master regulator.\n    *   Consider the `g1` mutant (75% resistance) and `g3` mutant (50% resistance). The `g1g3` double mutant has 10% resistance. This suggests that G1 and G3 are both important for resistance, and their functions are not fully redundant, nor is one completely masking the other's absence. The severe reduction in the double mutant implies they might act in parallel pathways that both contribute to the overall resistance, or that G1's function is partially dependent on G3 or vice-versa, or they both act on different downstream targets.\n\n    Let's look at the options provided:\n\n    *   **(A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** If G1 is the TF, its absence should lead to a significant reduction in resistance, which it does (75%). However, G2's absence leads to complete loss of resistance. If G2 is downstream of G1, then G1 being absent should not cause a more severe phenotype than G2 being absent. Also, G2 being epistatic to G1 means the phenotype of `g2` is seen in `g1g2`. This is true (0% resistance). But the data doesn't strongly support G1 as the primary TF over G2.\n\n    *   **(B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** If G2 is the TF, this fits the severe phenotype of `g2`. If G1 and G3 have the same promoter, they would be regulated together. Knocking out one would reduce resistance, and knocking out both would have a more pronounced effect. However, \"same promoter\" is a specific molecular mechanism not directly testable with these phenotypic data alone, but it could explain redundancy. If G3 is epistatic to G1, the phenotype of `g3` (50%) should be seen in `g1g3`. But `g1g3` has 10% resistance, not 50%. So, this is unlikely.\n\n    *   **(C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** G2 as TF fits. If G1 is epistatic to G3, the phenotype of `g1` (75%) should be seen in `g1g3`. But `g1g3` has 10% resistance. This contradicts G1 being epistatic to G3.\n\n    *   **(D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** G2 as TF fits. Gene redundancy between G1 and G3 explains why `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%) have reduced resistance, and `g1g3` (10%) has a much more severe reduction. This is consistent with them contributing to resistance in a partially overlapping manner. However, the statement \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is still problematic given the `g1g3` phenotype.\n\nLet's re-examine the concept of epistasis in the context of these results.\nIf G2 is a TF, its absence leads to 0% resistance. This is the most extreme phenotype.\nConsider the interaction between G1 and G3.\n- `g1`: 75%\n- `g3`: 50%\n- `g1g3`: 10%\n\nThe fact that `g1g3` is much lower than either single mutant suggests that G1 and G3 are not simply redundant in a way that one can fully compensate for the other. It's more like they contribute additively or synergistically to resistance, or act in parallel pathways.\n\nLet's reconsider the epistasis definition: A gene is epistatic to another if its phenotype is observed when both genes are mutated.\nIf G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the `g1g3` double mutant, the phenotype of `g1` should be observed. The phenotype of `g1` is 75% resistance. However, the `g1g3` double mutant shows 10% resistance. This means G1 is *not* epistatic to G3.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options and the data. The most robust conclusion is that G2 is a central regulator (likely TF) because its absence causes complete loss of resistance. The interaction between G1 and G3 is less clear-cut in terms of simple epistasis. The severe reduction in the double mutant `g1g3` compared to single mutants suggests they are both important and their functions are not fully compensated for by each other.\n\nLet's assume G2 is the TF.\n- `g1` (75%) vs `g3` (50%).\n- `g1g3` (10%).\n\nIf G1 were epistatic to G3, then the `g1g3` phenotype would be similar to `g1` (75%). This is not the case.\nIf G3 were epistatic to G1, then the `g1g3` phenotype would be similar to `g3` (50%). This is also not the case.\n\nThis pattern (single mutants have reduced function, double mutant has a much more severe reduction) is often indicative of genes acting in parallel pathways that both contribute to the phenotype, or genes with partially overlapping functions where the loss of both is significantly detrimental. This is often described as gene redundancy or additive effects.\n\nLet's re-examine the options with this understanding.\nThe most consistent part across options is \"G2 is a transcription factor\". This is strongly supported by its null phenotype.\n\nNow, let's look at the interaction between G1 and G3.\n- Option (B) suggests \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\". This is a molecular mechanism that could lead to redundancy.\n- Option (C) suggests \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\". Pleiotropy is about a gene affecting multiple traits, not directly about interaction in a single pathway.\n- Option (D) suggests \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\". This aligns with the observation that losing both G1 and G3 leads to a much greater loss of resistance than losing either alone.\n\nNow, let's consider the epistasis part. All options suggest some form of epistasis between G1 and G3, or G2 and G1.\n- Option (A): G2 is epistatic towards G1. This means the phenotype of `g2` (0%) is seen in `g1g2`. This is true.\n- Option (B): G3 is epistatic towards G1. This means the phenotype of `g3` (50%) is seen in `g1g3`. This is false (10% vs 50%).\n- Option (C): G1 is epistatic towards G3. This means the phenotype of `g1` (75%) is seen in `g1g3`. This is false (10% vs 75%).\n- Option (D): G1 is epistatic towards G3. This is false (10% vs 75%).\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction in the options regarding epistasis between G1 and G3, as the data does not support simple epistasis. However, let's reconsider the possibility of G2 being epistatic to G1.\n\nIf G2 is a TF, and G1 is downstream of G2, then the absence of G2 would lead to the absence of G1's function.\nThe phenotype of `g2` is 0% resistance.\nThe phenotype of `g1` is 75% resistance.\nThe phenotype of `g1g2` is 0% resistance.\nThis is consistent with G2 being epistatic to G1, meaning the absence of G2's function leads to the same phenotype as the absence of G1's function (or rather, the absence of G2's function causes a more severe phenotype that masks G1's contribution).\n\nLet's re-evaluate option (A): \"G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\".\n- If G1 is the TF, its absence leads to 75% resistance.\n- If G2 is epistatic to G1, then the `g1g2` phenotype should be the same as `g1`. This is not necessarily true, as epistasis means the epistatic gene's phenotype is observed. If G2 is epistatic to G1, then the `g1g2` phenotype should be the phenotype of `g2`. This is true (0%). However, this implies G2 is the primary regulator, not G1.\n\nLet's re-evaluate option (C): \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\".\n- G2 is TF: Consistent.\n- G1 is epistatic towards G3: Phenotype of `g1` (75%) should be seen in `g1g3`. This is not true (10%).\n\nLet's re-evaluate option (D): \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\".\n- G2 is TF: Consistent.\n- G1 and G3 show gene redundancy: Consistent with `g1` (75%), `g3` (50%), `g1g3` (10%).\n- G1 is epistatic towards G3: Not consistent with data (10% vs 75%).\n\nThere seems to be an issue with the epistasis claims in options (B), (C), and (D) regarding G1 and G3. Let's focus on the most robust findings:\n1.  G2 is a major regulator (likely TF) due to its null phenotype.\n2.  G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, and their combined loss is more severe than individual losses, suggesting redundancy or parallel action.\n\nLet's reconsider the epistasis of G2 towards G1.\nIf G2 is a TF, and G1 is downstream, then the absence of G2 would lead to the absence of G1's function.\n- `g1` phenotype: 75%\n- `g2` phenotype: 0%\n- `g1g2` phenotype: 0%\n\nIf G2 is epistatic to G1, it means the phenotype of the `g2` mutation is observed in the `g1g2` double mutant. This is true (0% resistance). This implies that G2's function is upstream or dominant over G1's function in determining the resistance phenotype.\n\nLet's look at option (A) again: \"G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\".\n- If G1 is the TF, its absence leads to 75% resistance.\n- If G2 is epistatic to G1, then the `g1g2` phenotype should be the phenotype of `g2`. This is true (0%).\n- However, if G1 is the TF, its absence should lead to a more severe phenotype than the absence of a downstream gene like G2. But `g2` has 0% resistance, while `g1` has 75%. This contradicts G1 being the primary TF.\n\nLet's reconsider option (C): \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\".\n- G2 is TF: Consistent.\n- G1 is epistatic towards G3: This means the phenotype of `g1` (75%) is seen in `g1g3`. This is not true (10%).\n\nLet's reconsider option (D): \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\".\n- G2 is TF: Consistent.\n- G1 and G3 show gene redundancy: Consistent with `g1` (75%), `g3` (50%), `g1g3` (10%).\n- G1 is epistatic towards G3: Not consistent with data (10% vs 75%).\n\nIt seems there might be an error in the options provided or a subtle interpretation of epistasis is required. However, the most consistent interpretation of the data points towards G2 being a central TF. The interaction between G1 and G3 is best described as redundancy or parallel contribution, given the `g1g3` phenotype.\n\nLet's assume the question implies a specific type of epistasis. If G1 is epistatic to G3, it means that the loss of G1 function masks the effect of G3 mutation. This is not observed here.\n\nLet's re-examine the possibility of G2 being epistatic to G1.\nIf G2 is epistatic to G1, then the phenotype of `g2` (0%) is observed in `g1g2`. This is true.\nThis implies that G2's function is dominant or upstream of G1's function in determining the resistance phenotype.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the options are trying to describe a scenario where G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream.\nIf G1 is epistatic to G3, it means that the phenotype of `g1` is observed when both are mutated. This is not the case.\n\nHowever, if we interpret \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" in the context of the options, and knowing that G2 is the TF, let's look at the combination that makes the most sense.\n\nThe most solid conclusion is:\n1.  G2 is a transcription factor.\n2.  G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, and their combined loss is more severe than individual losses, suggesting redundancy or parallel pathways.\n\nLet's check if any option fits these two points, even if the epistasis part is tricky.\n- Option (C): \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". G2 as TF is good. Pleiotropy is less direct. G1 epistatic to G3 is problematic.\n- Option (D): \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\". G2 as TF is good. G1 and G3 redundancy is good. G1 epistatic to G3 is problematic.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the question implies a specific order of action.\nIf G2 is the TF, it might regulate G1 and G3.\nIf G1 is epistatic to G3, it means G1 acts before G3 in a pathway, or its function is dominant.\nIf G1 is epistatic to G3, then in `g1g3`, the phenotype of `g1` should be seen. This is not the case.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the question is flawed or uses \"epistatic\" in a looser sense.\nThe most consistent interpretation of the data is:\n- G2 is a master regulator (TF).\n- G1 and G3 are important for resistance, and their functions are partially overlapping or parallel, leading to a severe phenotype when both are absent.\n\nLet's assume there's a typo in the options and try to find the \"best fit\".\nThe strongest evidence points to G2 being the TF. This is present in options (B), (C), and (D).\nThe interaction between G1 and G3 is best described as redundancy or parallel action. This is present in option (D).\n\nNow, let's revisit the epistasis claims.\nIf G1 is epistatic to G3, it means the phenotype of `g1` is seen in `g1g3`. This is not true.\nHowever, if we consider the possibility that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, and G1's pathway is more critical or has a stronger effect, then its absence would lead to a significant reduction. The combined absence of both pathways leads to a near-complete loss.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the question implies a specific type of epistasis where the epistatic gene's *absence* leads to the same phenotype as the *absence* of the hypostatic gene. This is not standard.\n\nLet's assume the options are designed to test the understanding of TF role and gene interactions.\nG2 is clearly the TF.\nG1 and G3 show redundancy.\n\nNow, let's look at the epistasis claim again.\nIf G1 is epistatic to G3, it means G1 masks G3.\nConsider the resistance levels:\ng1: 75%\ng3: 50%\ng1g3: 10%\n\nIf G1 is epistatic to G3, then the `g1g3` phenotype should be the same as `g1` (75%). This is not observed.\nIf G3 is epistatic to G1, then the `g1g3` phenotype should be the same as `g3` (50%). This is not observed.\n\nThis suggests that neither G1 nor G3 is epistatic to the other in a simple masking sense. The interaction is more complex, likely additive or synergistic, or parallel pathways.\n\nHowever, if we are forced to choose from the options, and G2 is definitely the TF, and G1/G3 redundancy is likely, then option (D) is the closest fit, despite the problematic epistasis claim.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is meant in a context where G1's function is more critical or upstream.\nIf G2 is the TF, it might activate G1 and G3.\nIf G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, and G1's pathway is more robust or contributes more to resistance, then its absence would lead to a greater reduction.\n`g1` (75%) vs `g3` (50%). This suggests G1's contribution is larger.\nThe combined loss `g1g3` (10%) is much worse than `g1` alone.\n\nLet's try to find a scenario where G1 is epistatic to G3.\nIf G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of `g1` is observed in `g1g3`. This is not the case.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the question is asking about the *effect* of the mutations.\nIf G2 is the TF, its absence causes complete loss of resistance.\nIf G1 and G3 are downstream and have redundant functions:\n- `g1` mutation: reduced resistance (75%)\n- `g3` mutation: reduced resistance (50%)\n- `g1g3` mutation: severely reduced resistance (10%)\n\nThis pattern strongly supports G1 and G3 having redundant functions.\n\nNow, let's look at the epistasis claim again.\nIf G1 is epistatic to G3, it means that the phenotype of `g1` is observed in the `g1g3` double mutant. This is not the case.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the question is poorly phrased or the options are not perfectly aligned with the data. However, we must select the best option.\n\nThe most certain conclusions are:\n1.  G2 is a transcription factor.\n2.  G1 and G3 exhibit gene redundancy (or parallel action).\n\nOption (D) states: \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\".\nThe first two parts are well-supported. The third part, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\", is not directly supported by the data if interpreted strictly.\n\nLet's consider if there's any other interpretation.\nIf G1 is epistatic to G3, it means that the presence of a functional G1 can mask the effect of a mutated G3.\nIn the `g1g3` mutant, we have 10% resistance.\nIf G1 were epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of `g1` (75%) would be seen in `g1g3`. This is not the case.\n\nLet's assume there's a mistake in the epistasis claim in the options and focus on the other parts.\nG2 is a TF.\nG1 and G3 show redundancy.\n\nOption (D) is the only one that correctly identifies G2 as a TF and G1/G3 as redundant. The epistasis claim is the only point of contention.\n\nLet's try to use Python to represent the resistance levels and see if any logical deduction can be made.\nWe can represent the \"functional state\" of resistance as a value. Let's assume wild-type has a resistance value of 1.\ng1: 0.75\ng2: 0.00\ng3: 0.50\ng1g3: 0.10\ng1g2: 0.00\ng2g3: 0.00\n\nLet's assign a \"contribution\" to each gene.\nIf G2 is a TF, its absence leads to 0. This suggests G2 is essential.\nLet's assume G2 is a TF that activates downstream components.\n\nConsider G1 and G3.\nIf they are redundant, their contributions might be additive or synergistic.\nLet's model resistance as a function of gene activity.\nR = f(G1, G2, G3)\n\nIf G2 is a TF, then R = f(G1, G3) if G2 is present, and R = 0 if G2 is absent.\nSo, the data for single mutants of G1 and G3, and the double mutant `g1g3`, are under the condition that G2 is present (wild-type).\nR(g1) = 0.75\nR(g3) = 0.50\nR(g1g3) = 0.10\n\nIf G1 and G3 contribute additively:\nR(g1g3) = R(g1) + R(g3) - R(g1) * R(g3) (if they are independent probabilities of functioning)\nR(g1g3) = 0.75 + 0.50 - (0.75 * 0.50) = 1.25 - 0.375 = 0.875. This is not 0.10.\n\nIf they contribute multiplicatively (e.g., sequential steps):\nR(g1g3) = R(g1) * R(g3) = 0.75 * 0.50 = 0.375. This is not 0.10.\n\nThe fact that `g1g3` (0.10) is much lower than either single mutant suggests a strong interaction, possibly synergistic or that they act in parallel pathways that are both crucial.\n\nLet's consider the possibility of epistasis in a different way.\nIf G1 is epistatic to G3, it means that the phenotype of `g1` is observed in `g1g3`. This is not the case.\n\nHowever, let's consider the possibility that the question is asking about the *order* of action.\nIf G2 is the TF, it acts first.\nThen, consider G1 and G3.\nIf G1 is epistatic to G3, it means G1 acts before G3.\nIf G1 acts before G3, then the absence of G1 would affect G3's function or expression.\n`g1` (75%)\n`g3` (50%)\n`g1g3` (10%)\n\nIf G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of `g1` should be seen in `g1g3`. This is not the case.\n\nLet's assume the option (D) is correct and try to justify it.\n- G2 is a transcription factor: Supported by the null phenotype.\n- G1 and G3 show gene redundancy: Supported by the `g1g3` phenotype being much worse than single mutants.\n- G1 is epistatic towards G3: This is the problematic part.\n\nCould \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" mean that G1's function is more critical or upstream in a way that its absence has a more pronounced effect than G3's absence, and this difference is observed in the single mutants?\n`g1` (75%) vs `g3` (50%). Yes, the absence of G1 leads to a greater reduction in resistance than the absence of G3. This could be interpreted as G1 having a more dominant role or being upstream of G3 in some sense, which might be what \"epistatic\" is loosely referring to here.\n\nLet's use Python to represent the data and check the consistency of the statements.\n\n**Calculation:**\n```python\n# Resistance levels (0 = no resistance, 1 = full resistance)\nresistance = {\n    \"WT\": 1.0,\n    \"g1\": 0.75,\n    \"g2\": 0.00,\n    \"g3\": 0.50,\n    \"g1g2\": 0.00,\n    \"g1g3\": 0.10,\n    \"g2g3\": 0.00,\n}\n\n# Analysis of statements:\n\n# Statement 1: G2 is a transcription factor.\n# Evidence: g2 mutant has 0% resistance. Double mutants with g2 (g1g2, g2g3) also have 0% resistance.\n# This indicates G2 is essential and likely a master regulator. This is consistent.\n\n# Statement 2: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy.\n# Evidence:\n# g1: 0.75\n# g3: 0.50\n# g1g3: 0.10\n# The double mutant phenotype (0.10) is much more severe than either single mutant.\n# This suggests that G1 and G3 perform similar or overlapping functions, and losing both has a compounded effect.\n# This is consistent with gene redundancy or parallel pathways.\n\n# Statement 3: G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n# Definition of epistasis: A gene is epistatic to another if its phenotype is observed when both genes are mutated.\n# If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of g1 (0.75) should be observed in g1g3.\n# Observed phenotype of g1g3 is 0.10.\n# 0.10 != 0.75.\n# Therefore, G1 is NOT epistatic to G3 in the standard sense.\n\n# Let's check other epistasis claims from other options for completeness.\n# Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1.\n# If G2 is epistatic to G1, then the phenotype of g2 (0.00) should be observed in g1g2.\n# Observed phenotype of g1g2 is 0.00.\n# 0.00 == 0.00. This statement is consistent with the data.\n# However, Option A also states \"G1 is a transcription factor\", which is less supported than G2 being the TF.\n\n# Option B: G3 is epistatic towards G1.\n# If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the phenotype of g3 (0.50) should be observed in g1g3.\n# Observed phenotype of g1g3 is 0.10.\n# 0.10 != 0.50. This statement is not consistent.\n\n# Option C: G1 is epistatic towards G3.\n# If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of g1 (0.75) should be observed in g1g3.\n# Observed phenotype of g1g3 is 0.10.\n# 0.10 != 0.75. This statement is not consistent.\n\n# Re-evaluating the options based on the most robust findings:\n# G2 is a TF.\n# G1 and G3 show redundancy.\n\n# Option D: \"G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\"\n# The first two parts are strongly supported. The third part is not.\n\n# Let's consider the possibility that \"epistatic\" is used loosely to mean \"more important\" or \"upstream\".\n# If G1 is \"more important\" than G3, its absence causes a greater reduction (0.75 vs 0.50).\n# This could be what is implied by \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" in this context.\n\n# Given the options, Option D provides the most consistent description of the genetic interactions,\n# with the caveat that the term \"epistatic\" might be used in a non-standard way for the G1/G3 interaction.\n# The core findings of G2 as TF and G1/G3 redundancy are well-supported by the data.\n\nprint(\"Resistance Data:\")\nfor mutant, res in resistance.items():\n    print(f\"{mutant}: {res*100:.0f}%\")\n\nprint(\"\\nAnalysis of statements:\")\nprint(\"1.
