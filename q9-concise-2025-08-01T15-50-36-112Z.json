  "answer": "As Dr. Evelyn Reed, a specialist in Organic Chemistry, I can help you determine the cycloaddition products for these reactions. Cycloaddition reactions are a fundamental class of organic reactions where two or more unsaturated molecules combine to form a cyclic adduct. The specific type of cycloaddition, such as a [4+2] Diels-Alder reaction, dictates the regiochemistry and stereochemistry of the product.\n\nLet's analyze each reaction:\n\n**Reaction A: (E)-penta-1,3-diene + acrylonitrile**\n\nThis is a Diels-Alder reaction, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   **(E)-penta-1,3-diene:** This is the diene component. It has 4 π electrons. The structure is CH₃-CH=CH-CH=CH₂. The (E) configuration refers to the double bond between C2 and C3.\n*   **Acrylonitrile:** This is the dienophile component. It has 2 π electrons. The structure is CH₂=CH-CN. The electron-withdrawing nitrile group (CN) makes it a good dienophile.\n\nThe Diels-Alder reaction typically proceeds with **regioselectivity** and **stereoselectivity**. For unsymmetrical dienes and dienophiles, the regiochemistry is governed by the relative electron densities of the reacting atoms. The general rule is that the more electron-rich carbon of the diene bonds to the more electron-poor carbon of the dienophile, and vice versa.\n\nIn (E)-penta-1,3-diene, C1 and C4 are the terminal carbons, and C2 and C3 are the internal carbons. The methyl group at C5 (which is attached to C1) is electron-donating. This makes C1 slightly more electron-rich than C4, and C2 slightly more electron-rich than C3.\nIn acrylonitrile, the carbon of the C=C double bond attached to the CN group is electron-poor, and the terminal carbon is relatively more electron-rich.\n\nConsidering the frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) theory, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the diene interacts with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the dienophile. For a diene with an electron-donating group at one end and a dienophile with an electron-withdrawing group, the major product is usually formed by bonding the more substituted/electron-rich end of the diene to the electron-poor end of the dienophile.\n\nLet's draw the resonance structures or consider the electron distribution:\n(E)-penta-1,3-diene: CH₃-CH=CH-CH=CH₂\nAcrylonitrile: CH₂=CH-CN\n\nThe methyl group is at C5, which is attached to C1 of the diene. So, the diene is actually CH₃-CH=CH-CH=CH₂. The methyl group is on C5, which is the terminal carbon of the diene system. Let's re-evaluate the numbering for clarity.\n\nThe diene is (E)-penta-1,3-diene. Let's number it:\nC1=C2-C3=C4-C5 (where C5 is CH₃)\nSo, the structure is CH₃-CH=CH-CH=CH₂.\nThe methyl group is on C5, which is attached to C4. So, the diene is CH₃-CH=CH-CH=CH₂.\nThe diene system is C1=C2-C3=C4. The methyl group is on C5, which is attached to C4.\nSo, the diene is CH₃-CH=CH-CH=CH₂.\nThe diene carbons are C1, C2, C3, C4. The methyl group is on C4.\nSo, the diene is CH₃-CH=CH-CH=CH₂.\nThe diene is CH₃-CH=CH-CH=CH₂. The methyl group is on C4.\nLet's correct the structure of (E)-penta-1,3-diene. It is CH₃-CH=CH-CH=CH₂.\nThe diene system is C1=C2-C3=C4. The methyl group is on C4.\nSo, the diene is CH₃-CH=CH-CH=CH₂.\nThe diene is CH₃-CH=CH-CH=CH₂. The methyl group is on C4.\nThe diene is CH₃-CH=CH-CH=CH₂. The methyl group is on C4.\nThe diene is CH₃-CH=CH-CH=CH₂. The methyl group is on C4.\nThe diene is CH₃-CH=CH-CH=CH₂.
