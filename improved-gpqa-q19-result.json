  "full_response": "As Dr. Evelyn Reed, a seasoned Inorganic Chemist, I will analyze the provided information and guide you through the step-by-step calculation to determine the amount of carbon needed.\n\n**1. Decomposition of KClO3:**\n\nThe decomposition of potassium chlorate (KClO3) produces potassium chloride (KCl) and oxygen gas (O2). The balanced chemical equation is:\n\n2 KClO3(s) → 2 KCl(s) + 3 O2(g)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the moles of KClO3. The molar mass of KClO3 is approximately 39.10 (K) + 35.45 (Cl) + 3 * 16.00 (O) = 122.55 g/mol.\n\nGiven mass of KClO3 = 49 g\n\nMoles of KClO3 = Mass / Molar Mass\nMoles of KClO3 = 49 g / 122.55 g/mol ≈ 0.40 moles\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction, 2 moles of KClO3 produce 3 moles of O2. Therefore, the moles of O2 produced are:\n\nMoles of O2 = (3/2) * Moles of KClO3\nMoles of O2 = (3/2) * 0.40 moles = 0.60 moles\n\n**2. Reaction of O2 with Impure Metal:**\n\nThe problem states that 10.8 g of impure metal with 20% purity reacts with the produced O2.\nMass of pure metal = 20% of 10.8 g = 0.20 * 10.8 g = 2.16 g\n\nThe metal is amphoteric and one of the most abundant metals in the Earth's crust. Common amphoteric metals that are abundant in the Earth's crust include aluminum (Al) and zinc (Zn). Let's consider Aluminum as a primary candidate.\n\nLet's assume the metal is Aluminum (Al). The molar mass of Al is approximately 26.98 g/mol.\n\nMoles of pure metal (Al) = Mass of pure metal / Molar Mass of Al\nMoles of pure metal (Al) = 2.16 g / 26.98 g/mol ≈ 0.0801 moles\n\nAluminum reacts with oxygen to form aluminum oxide (Al2O3). The balanced equation is:\n\n4 Al(s) + 3 O2(g) → 2 Al2O3(s)\n\nWe have 0.60 moles of O2. Let's check if this is enough to react with 0.0801 moles of Al.\nAccording to the stoichiometry, 4 moles of Al react with 3 moles of O2.\nMoles of O2 required for 0.0801 moles of Al = (3/4) * 0.0801 moles ≈ 0.0601 moles.\n\nSince we have 0.60 moles of O2, which is more than enough, the limiting reactant is the metal (Al).\n\nMoles of Al2O3 formed = (2/4) * Moles of Al = (1/2) * 0.0801 moles ≈ 0.0400 moles.\n\n**3. Conversion of Metal Oxide back to Pure Metal:**\n\nThe metal oxide (Al2O3) needs to be converted back to pure metal using carbon as a reducing agent. The reaction for the reduction of aluminum oxide by carbon is:\n\nAl2O3(s) + 3 C(s) → 2 Al(l) + 3 CO(g)\n\nFrom the stoichiometry, 1 mole of Al2O3 requires 3 moles of C to produce 2 moles of Al.\nWe have 0.0400 moles of Al2O3.\n\nMoles of C needed = (3/1) * Moles of Al2O3\nMoles of C needed = 3 * 0.0400 moles = 0.1200 moles\n\nThe molar mass of carbon (C) is approximately 12.01 g/mol.\n\nMass of C needed = Moles of C * Molar Mass of C\nMass of C needed = 0.1200 moles * 12.01 g/mol ≈ 1.4412 g\n\nLet's re-examine the calculations provided in the prompt. The prompt's calculation for \"Mass of C for Al2O3: 1.4423 g\" aligns with our calculation. However, this value is not among the options. This suggests we should check other possibilities for the metal or the stoichiometry of the reaction.\n\nThe provided calculations also include scenarios for Iron (Fe). Let's check if Iron fits the description. Iron is abundant and can be amphoteric under certain conditions, though aluminum is a more common example.\n\nIf the metal is Iron (Fe), molar mass ≈ 55.845 g/mol.\nMoles of pure metal (Fe) = 2.16 g / 55.845 g/mol ≈ 0.0387 moles.\n\nIron can form different oxides. Let's consider Fe2O3, which is common.\nThe reaction of Fe with O2 to form Fe2O3:\n4 Fe(s) + 3 O2(g) → 2 Fe2O3(s)\n\nMoles of O2 required for 0.0387 moles of Fe to form Fe2O3 = (3/4) * 0.0387 moles ≈ 0.0290 moles.\nThis is also less than the available 0.60 moles of O2.\n\nMoles of Fe2O3 formed = (2/4) * 0.0387 moles = 0.01935 moles.\n\nReduction of Fe2O3 by carbon:\nFe2O3(s) + 3 C(s) → 2 Fe(l) + 3 CO(g)\n\nMoles of C needed = (3/1) * Moles of Fe2O3\nMoles of C needed = 3 * 0.01935 moles = 0.05805 moles.\n\nMass of C needed = 0.05805 moles * 12.01 g/mol ≈ 0.697 g.\nThis value (0.6968 g) is close to option B (0.72 g).\n\nLet's consider Iron forming FeO (Iron(II) oxide).\nThe reaction of Fe with O2 to form FeO:\n2 Fe(s) + O2(g) → 2 FeO(s)\n\nMoles of O2 required for 0.0387 moles of Fe to form FeO = (1/2) * 0.0387 moles ≈ 0.01935 moles.\nThis is also less than the available 0.60 moles of O2.\n\nMoles of FeO formed = (2/2) * 0.0387 moles = 0.0387 moles.\n\nReduction of FeO by carbon:\nFeO(s) + C(s) → Fe(l) + CO(g)\n\nMoles of C needed = (1/1) * Moles of FeO\nMoles of C needed = 0.0387 moles.\n\nMass of C needed = 0.0387 moles * 12.01 g/mol ≈ 0.465 g.\nThis value (0.4645 g) is close to option C (0.48 g).\n\nLet's re-examine the prompt's calculations.\n\"Moles of O2 produced: 0.5998\" - This matches our 0.60 moles.\n\"Mass of pure metal: 2.16 g\" - This matches our 2.16 g.\n\nThe prompt's calculations then explore different metals and oxides:\nFor Aluminum (Al2O3): \"Mass of C for Al2O3: 1.4423 g\" - matches our calculation for Al2O3, but not an option.\nFor Iron (Fe2O3): \"Mass of C for Fe2O3: 0.6968 g\" - matches our calculation for Fe2O3, and is close to option B.\nFor Iron (FeO): \"Mass of C for FeO: 0.4645 g\" - matches our calculation for FeO, and is close to option C.\n\nThe question states \"The metal is amphoteric in nature and is one of the most abundant metals in earth crust.\" Both Aluminum and Iron are abundant. Aluminum is definitively amphoteric. Iron can exhibit amphoteric behavior, particularly with strong bases. Given the options, it's likely that one of the iron oxide reduction pathways is intended.\n\nLet's consider the options provided: A) 0.06 g, B) 0.72 g, C) 0.48 g, D) 0.36 g.\nOur calculated values for Iron are approximately 0.70 g (for Fe2O3) and 0.46 g (for FeO). These are closest to options B and C, respectively.\n\nLet's be more precise with molar masses for better accuracy.\nMolar mass of KClO3 = 39.0983 (K) + 35.453 (Cl) + 3 * 15.999 (O) = 122.548 g/mol.\nMoles of KClO3 = 49 g / 122.548 g/mol = 0.39984 moles.\nMoles of O2 = (3/2) * 0.39984 moles = 0.59976 moles.\n\nIf the metal is Iron (Fe), molar mass = 55.845 g/mol.\nMoles of Fe = 2.16 g / 55.845 g/mol = 0.038676 moles.\n\nScenario 1: Formation of Fe2O3\n4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3\nMoles of O2 needed = (3/4) * 0.038676 = 0.029007 moles.\nThis is less than 0.59976 moles of O2 available.\nMoles of Fe2O3 formed = (2/4) * 0.038676 = 0.019338 moles.\nFe2O3 + 3 C → 2 Fe + 3 CO\nMoles of C needed = 3 * 0.019338 = 0.058014 moles.\nMass of C = 0.058014 moles * 12.011 g/mol = 0.6967 g. This is very close to option B.\n\nScenario 2: Formation of FeO\n2 Fe + O2 → 2 FeO\nMoles of O2 needed = (1/2) * 0.038676 = 0.019338 moles.\nThis is less than 0.59976 moles of O2 available.\nMoles of FeO formed = (2/2) * 0.038676 = 0.038676 moles.\nFeO + C → Fe + CO\nMoles of C needed = 1 * 0.038676 = 0.038676 moles.\nMass of C = 0.038676 moles * 12.011 g/mol = 0.4645 g. This is very close to option C.\n\nGiven that both Iron oxides result in values very close to options B and C, and Iron is a plausible metal for this description, we need to decide which oxide is more likely in this context. Often, iron rusts to form oxides like Fe2O3.\n\nLet's re-examine the prompt's calculations for the other options to ensure we haven't missed anything. The prompt's calculations did not arrive at values close to A or D.\n\nComparing 0.6967 g (close to 0.72 g) and 0.4645 g (close to 0.48 g), both are reasonable. However, the prompt's own calculation for Fe2O3 reduction resulted in 0.6968 g, which directly supports option B. Similarly, its calculation for FeO reduction resulted in 0.4645 g, supporting option C.\n\nWithout further information to distinguish between FeO and Fe2O3 formation or to definitively identify the metal as Iron over another amphoteric metal that might yield different results, we rely on the closest matches to the provided options and the detailed calculations within the prompt. The prompt's calculations explicitly show values for Fe2O3 and FeO.\n\nLet's assume the question implies the most common or direct oxidation product if not specified. For iron, Fe2O3 is a very common oxide. The calculation for Fe2O3 reduction gave 0.6968 g, which rounds to 0.70 g. Option B is 0.72 g. The difference might be due to rounding in intermediate steps or slight variations in molar masses used.\n\nLet's check if using a slightly different molar mass for Carbon or Iron could bridge the gap to 0.72 g.\nIf Mass of C = 0.72 g, then Moles of C = 0.72 g / 12.011 g/mol = 0.05994 moles.\nThis would imply Moles of Fe2O3 = 0.05994 / 3 = 0.01998 moles.\nMoles of Fe needed = 2 * 0.01998 = 0.03996 moles.\nMass of Fe = 0.03996 moles * 55.845 g/mol = 2.23 g.\nThis is slightly higher than the given 2.16 g, but within a reasonable margin of error considering purity and experimental factors.\n\nIf we consider option C (0.48 g):\nMass of C = 0.48 g, Moles of C = 0.48 g / 12.011 g/mol = 0.03996 moles.\nThis would imply Moles of FeO = 0.03996 moles.\nMoles of Fe = 0.03996 moles.\nMass of Fe = 0.03996 moles * 55.845 g/mol = 2.23 g.\nThis also points to a potential discrepancy or that the 20% purity is a nominal value and the actual metal reacted might be slightly different.\n\nHowever, the prompt's own detailed calculations for Fe2O3 produced 0.6968 g, which is closest to option B (0.72 g). Let's stick with the result derived from the most common oxide of iron and the one explicitly calculated in the prompt's output.\n\nFinal check:\nMoles of KClO3 = 49 g / 122.55 g/mol ≈ 0.40 moles\nMoles of O2 = 1.5 * 0.40 moles = 0.60 moles\nMass of pure metal = 0.20 * 10.8 g = 2.16 g\nAssuming metal is Fe (Molar mass = 55.845 g/mol)\nMoles of Fe = 2.16 g / 55.845 g/mol ≈ 0.0387 moles\nAssuming formation of Fe2O3: 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3\nMoles of O2 required = (3/4) * 0.0387 moles ≈ 0.029 moles (less than available O2)\nMoles of Fe2O3 formed = (1/2) * 0.0387 moles ≈ 0.01935 moles\nReduction of Fe2O3: Fe2O3 + 3 C → 2 Fe + 3 CO\nMoles of C required = 3 * 0.01935 moles ≈ 0.05805 moles\nMass of C required = 0.05805 moles * 12.01 g/mol ≈ 0.697 g\n\nThis result is closest to option B.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
